start role user
Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class EchoIntLoop_Mutant1 {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: x >= 0
D1: return_value == x + 1
T2: x < 0
D2: return_value == 1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as x: -32768	，the output of the program violates T: x < 0	D: return_value == 1，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
