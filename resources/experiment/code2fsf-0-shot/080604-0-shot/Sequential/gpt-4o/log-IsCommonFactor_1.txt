Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant1 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 || b % factor == 0; // changed from '&&' to '||'
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0
D1: return_value == true
T2: factor != 0 && b % factor == 0
D2: return_value == true
T3: factor != 0 && a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0
D3: return_value == false
T4: factor == 0
D4: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(factor != 0 && a % factor == 0) && (factor != 0 && b % factor == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=1073807360, b=0, factor=-1073807360]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
