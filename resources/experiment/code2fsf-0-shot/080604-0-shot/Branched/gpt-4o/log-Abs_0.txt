start role user
Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class Abs_Original {

    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return -num;
        else
            return num;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
num < 0
D1:
return_value == -num
T2:
num >= 0
D2:
return_value == num
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
Current conversation round is: [1]
