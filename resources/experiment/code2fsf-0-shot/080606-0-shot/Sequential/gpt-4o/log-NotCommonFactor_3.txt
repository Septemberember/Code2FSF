Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant3 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 || b % factor == 0; // Changed != to == in second condition
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
D1: return_value == true

T2:
D2: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
