Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class AddLoop_Mutant5 {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n >= 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n >= 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```

T1: y > 0
D1: return_value == x + y + 1
T2: y < 0
D2: return_value == x + y - 1
T3: y == 0
D3: return_value == x
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as x: 0	y: 0	，the output of the program violates T: y == 0	D: return_value == x，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
