Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class SafeLanding_Mutant3 {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt >= 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
*end* role user

```
T1: height > 5
D1: return_value == 0

T2: speed > 3
D2: return_value == 0

T3: tilt >= 10
D3: return_value == 0

T4: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt < 10
D4: return_value == 1
```
*end* role assistant

It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(height > 5) && (speed > 3)] is satisfiable assigned as [tilt=0, speed=4, height=6]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
