Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class SmallestEvenMul_Mutant3 {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n / 2 == 0 ? n : 2 * n;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 0 && n != 0
D1: return_value == n
T2: n % 2 != 0
D2: return_value == 2 * n
T3: n == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as n: 6914	，the output of the program violates T: n % 2 == 0 && n != 0	D: return_value == n，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
