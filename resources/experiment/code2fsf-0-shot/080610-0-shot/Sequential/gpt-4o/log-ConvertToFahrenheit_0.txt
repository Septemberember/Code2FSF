Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class ConvertToFahrenheit_Original {

    public static double convertTemperature(double celsius) {
        return celsius * 1.80 + 32.00;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
D1: return_value == celsius * 1.80 + 32.00
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
