Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant3 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 || b % factor == 0; // Changed != to == in second condition
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception
T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0)
D2: return_value == true
T3: factor != 0 && (a % factor == 0) && (b % factor == 0)
D3: return_value == false
T4: factor != 0 && (a % factor == 0) && (b % factor != 0)
D4: return_value == true
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as a: 66	b: -32768	factor: 2	，the output of the program violates T: factor != 0 && (a % factor == 0) && (b % factor == 0)	D: return_value == false，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
*end* role user
