Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NumberOfCuts_Mutant5 {

    public static int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n - 1; // mutated line
        }
        return n;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n == 1
D1: return_value == 0
T2: n % 2 == 0
D2: return_value == n - 1
T3: n % 2 != 0
D3: return_value == n
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(n == 1) && (n % 2 != 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [n=1]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
