Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class DivisorGame_Mutant4 {
    public static int divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
D1: return_value == n % 2
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
