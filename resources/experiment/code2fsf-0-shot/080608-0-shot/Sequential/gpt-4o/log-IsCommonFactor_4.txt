Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant4 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a / factor == 0 && b % factor == 0; // changed '%' to '/' at a % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
D1: return_value == true
T2: factor == 0
D2: Exception
T3: (a / factor != 0 || b % factor != 0) && factor != 0
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((factor == 0)||((a / factor != 0 || b % factor != 0) && factor != 0)))is satisfiable assigned as !((factor == 0)||((a / factor != 0 || b % factor != 0) && factor != 0))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
