start role user
Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class CanWinNim_Mutant2 {
    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 3 != 0;   // Change 4 to 3
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
n % 3 == 0
D1:
return_value == false

T2:
n % 3 != 0
D2:
return_value == true
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
Current conversation round is: [1]
