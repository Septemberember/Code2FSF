Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant5 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b / factor == 0; // changed '%' to '/' at b % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
Exception: factor == 0
T2: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b / factor == 0
D2: return_value == true
T3: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b / factor != 0)
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b / factor == 0)||(factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b / factor != 0))))is satisfiable assigned as !((factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b / factor == 0)||(factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b / factor != 0)))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
*end* role user
