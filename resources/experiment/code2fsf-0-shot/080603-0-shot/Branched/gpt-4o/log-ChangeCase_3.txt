Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class ChangeCase_Mutant3 {

    public static char changeCase(char c) {
        char result = ' ';
        if (c > 'z') {
            result = c;
        } else if (c >= 'a') {
            result = (char) (c - 'a' + 'A');
        } else if (c > 'Z') {
            result = c;
        } else if (c >= 'A') {
            result = (char) (c - 'A' + 'a');
        } else {
            result = c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```

It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(c > 'z') && (c >= 'a')] is satisfiable assigned as [c={]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
