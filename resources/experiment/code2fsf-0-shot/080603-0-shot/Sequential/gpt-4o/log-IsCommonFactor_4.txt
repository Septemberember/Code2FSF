Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant4 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a / factor == 0 && b % factor == 0; // changed '%' to '/' at a % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
Exception: factor == 0
T2:
D2: return_value == (a / factor == 0 && b % factor == 0)
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
