start role user
Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class Return100_Original {
    public static int return100 () {
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
D1: return_value == 100
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
