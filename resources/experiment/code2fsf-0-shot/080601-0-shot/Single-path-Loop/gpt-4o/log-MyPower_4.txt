start role user
Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MyPower_Mutant4 {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
	        res = res * x;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n < 0
D1: Exception:
T2: x == 0 && n == 0
D2: Exception:
T3: x == 0 && n > 0
D3: return_value == 0
T4: x != 0 && n == 0
D4: return_value == 1
T5: x != 0 && n > 0
D5: return_value == x ** (n + 1)
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
Under T :n < 0ï¼Œspecifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int x = 29;
int n = -66;
    int result = MyPower_Mutant4.power(x, n);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
