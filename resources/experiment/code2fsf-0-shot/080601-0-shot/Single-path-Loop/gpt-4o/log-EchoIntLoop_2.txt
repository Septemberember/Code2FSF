Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class EchoIntLoop_Mutant2 {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: x == 0
D1: return_value == 1
T2: x > 0
D2: return_value == x + 1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((x == 0)||(x > 0)))is satisfiable assigned as !((x == 0)||(x > 0))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
Current conversation round is: [1]
