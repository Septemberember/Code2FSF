public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant2 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0; // changed '==' to '!=' at a % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user

```
T1:
a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0
D1:
return_value == false

T2:
a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0
D2:

T3:
b % factor != 0
D3:
return_value == false

T4:
factor == 0
D4:
