Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class DivisionOverflow_Mutant5 {
    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        //~should_fail
        int tmp = denom / nom; // swapping numerator and denominator
        return tmp;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: denom == 0
D1: Exception
T2: nom == 0
D2: Exception
T3: denom != 0 && nom != 0
D3: return_value == denom / nom
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(denom == 0) && (nom == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [nom=0, denom=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
