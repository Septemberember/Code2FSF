Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant2 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0; // Changed || to &&
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1:
D1: return_value == true

T2:
D2: return_value == false

T3: factor == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((factor == 0)))is satisfiable assigned as !((factor == 0))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
*end* role user
