Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class GPSCheck_Mutant3 {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: satellites < 4
D1: return_value == 2
T2: signalStrength < 20
D2: return_value == 2
T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: return_value == 0
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(satellites < 4) && (signalStrength < 20)] is satisfiable assigned as [satellites=3, signalStrength=19]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
