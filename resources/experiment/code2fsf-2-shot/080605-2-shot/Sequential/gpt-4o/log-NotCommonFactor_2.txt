Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant2 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0; // Changed || to &&
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0
D2: return_value == true

T3: a % factor == 0 || b % factor == 0
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(factor == 0) && (a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=-1, b=-1, factor=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
