Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactorBranch_Mutant3 {
    public static boolean isCommonFactor (int a, int b, int factor) {
        if (a % factor != 1) {
            return false;
        }
        if (b % factor != 1) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: a % factor != 1 || b % factor != 1
D1: return_value == false

T2: a % factor == 1 && b % factor == 1
D2: return_value == true

T3: factor == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(a % factor != 1 || b % factor != 1) && (factor == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=-2, b=1, factor=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
