Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class SmallestEvenMul_Mutant3 {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n / 2 == 0 ? n : 2 * n;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n / 2 == 0
D1: return_value == n

T2: n / 2 != 0
D2: return_value == 2 * n

T3: n == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(n / 2 == 0) && (n == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [n=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
