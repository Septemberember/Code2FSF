Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class AltitudeController_Mutant4 {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight,int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;
        absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError >= 30) { //Changed > to >=
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;

It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(targetHeight - currentHeight < -30) && (targetHeight - currentHeight < -20 || (targetHeight - currentHeight <= -30 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30))] is satisfiable assigned as [currentHeight=0, targetHeight=-2147483648]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
