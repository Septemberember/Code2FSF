Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PassPillowBranch_Mutant4 {
    public static int passPillow(int n, int time) {
        time = time % ((n - 1) * 3); // changed multiplier 2 to 3
        if (time < n) {
            return time + 1;
        }
        return n * 2 - time - 1;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: time % ((n - 1) * 3) < n && n > 1
D1: return_value == time % ((n - 1) * 3) + 1

T2: time % ((n - 1) * 3) >= n && n > 1
D2: return_value == n * 2 - time % ((n - 1) * 3) - 1

T3: n <= 1
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
Under T :n <= 1，specifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int n = 0;
int time = 0;
    int result = PassPillowBranch_Mutant4.passPillow(n, time);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
