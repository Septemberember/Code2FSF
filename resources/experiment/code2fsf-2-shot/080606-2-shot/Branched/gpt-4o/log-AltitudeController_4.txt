Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```

        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;

        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError >= 30) { //Changed > to >=
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;

There exists (targetHeight - currentHeight) >= 30 && (targetHeight - currentHeight) < 0 in the FSF, and it is a unsatisfiable，please regenerate the FSF，avoiding contains this kind of unsatisfiable T!
