Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant4 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1; // Changed 0 to 1 in second condition
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1)
D2: return_value == true

T3: factor != 0 && !(a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1)
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
