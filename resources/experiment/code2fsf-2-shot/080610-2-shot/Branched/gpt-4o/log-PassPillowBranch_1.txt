Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PassPillowBranch_Mutant1 {
    public static int passPillow(int n, int time) {
        time = time % (n + 1) * 2; // changed subtraction to addition
        if (time < n) {
            return time + 1;
        }
        return n * 2 - time - 1;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n <= 0 || time < 0
D1: Exception

T2: n > 0 && time >= 0 && time % ((n + 1) * 2) < n
D2: return_value == (time % ((n + 1) * 2)) + 1

T3: n > 0 && time >= 0 && time % ((n + 1) * 2) >= n
D3: return_value == n * 2 - (time % ((n + 1) * 2)) - 1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
Under T :n <= 0 || time < 0ï¼Œspecifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int n = 0;
int time = -32768;
    int result = PassPillowBranch_Mutant1.passPillow(n, time);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
