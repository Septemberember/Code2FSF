Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant1 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 || b % factor != 0; // Changed != to ==
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor == 0 || b % factor == 0)
D2: return_value == false

T3: factor != 0 && a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0
D3: return_value == true
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as a: -32768	b: 0	factor: -32768	，the output of the program violates T: factor != 0 && (a % factor == 0 || b % factor == 0)	D: return_value == false，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
*end* role user
