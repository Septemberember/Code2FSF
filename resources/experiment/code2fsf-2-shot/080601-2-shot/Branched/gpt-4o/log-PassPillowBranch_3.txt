Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PassPillowBranch_Mutant3 {
    public static int passPillow(int n, int time) {
        time = time % ((n - 1) * 2);
        if (time < n) {
            return time + 1;
        }
        return n * 2 - time - 2;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n <= 1 || time % ((n - 1) * 2) < n
D1: return_value == (time % ((n - 1) * 2)) + 1

T2: n > 1 && time % ((n - 1) * 2) >= n
D2: return_value == n * 2 - (time % ((n - 1) * 2)) - 2

T3: n - 1 == 0 && time % ((n - 1) * 2) == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(n <= 1 || time % ((n - 1) * 2) < n) && (n - 1 == 0 && time % ((n - 1) * 2) == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [n=1, time=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
