Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MySqrt_Mutant1 {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 1, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```

T1: x == 0
D1: Exception

T2: x == 1
D2: return_value == 1

T3: x > 1
D3: return_value * return_value <= x && (return_value + 1) * (return_value + 1) > x

T4: x < 0
D4: return_value == -1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
Under T :x == 0ï¼Œspecifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int x = 0;
    int result = MySqrt_Mutant1.mySqrt(x);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
