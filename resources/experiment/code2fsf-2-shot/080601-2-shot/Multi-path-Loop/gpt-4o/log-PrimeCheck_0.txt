Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PrimeCheck_Original {

    public static boolean isPrime(int a) {
        int i = 2;
        int mid = a / 2;
        while (i <= mid) {
            if (a % i == 0)
                return false;
            i++;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: a < 2
D1: return_value == false

T2: a == 2
D2: return_value == true

T3: a > 2 && (exists i in [2, a/2] such that a % i == 0)
D3: return_value == false

T4: a > 2 && (for all i in [2, a/2], a % i != 0)
D4: return_value == true
```

It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
