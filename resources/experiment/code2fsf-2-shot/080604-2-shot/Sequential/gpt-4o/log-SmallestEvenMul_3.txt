Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class SmallestEvenMul_Mutant3 {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n / 2 == 0 ? n : 2 * n;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n == 0
D1: Exception

T2: n != 0 && n % 2 == 0
D2: return_value == n

T3: n != 0 && n % 2 != 0
D3: return_value == 2 * n
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
Under T :n == 0ï¼Œspecifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int n = 0;
    int result = SmallestEvenMul_Mutant3.smallestEvenMultiple(n);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
