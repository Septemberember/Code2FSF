Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonMultiple_Mutant4 {
    public static boolean isCommonMultiple(int a, int b, int m) {
        return m % a < 0 && m % b < 0;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: m % a < 0 && m % b < 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: !(m % a < 0 && m % b < 0)
D2: return_value == false

T3: a == 0 || b == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(m % a < 0 && m % b < 0) && (a == 0 || b == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=1438, b=0, m=-753928508]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
