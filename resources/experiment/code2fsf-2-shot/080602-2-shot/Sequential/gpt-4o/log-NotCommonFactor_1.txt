Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant1 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 || b % factor != 0; // Changed != to ==
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0
D2: return_value == true

T3: factor != 0 && a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0
D3: return_value == true

T4: factor != 0 && a % factor != 0 && b % factor != 0
D4: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as a: 22274	b: 32613	factor: 3	，the output of the program violates T: factor != 0 && a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0	D: return_value == true，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
