Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class DivisorGame_Mutant1 {
    public static boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 1;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 1
D1: return_value == true

T2: n % 2 == 0
D2: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((n % 2 == 1)||(n % 2 == 0)))is satisfiable assigned as !((n % 2 == 1)||(n % 2 == 0))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 1
D1: return_value == true

T2: n % 2 != 1
D2: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role remark
Validation SUCCESS--totally verified!
Current conversation round is: [2]
