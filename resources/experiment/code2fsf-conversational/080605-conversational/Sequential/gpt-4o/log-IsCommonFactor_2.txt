Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant2 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0; // changed '==' to '!=' at a % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: !(a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0)
D2: return_value == false

T3: factor == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0) && (factor == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=-1, b=0, factor=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: factor != 0 && a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0
D2: return_value == true

T3: factor != 0 && !(a % factor != 0 && b % factor == 0)
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role remark
Validation SUCCESS--totally verified!
Current conversation round is: [2]
