Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactorBranch_Mutant2 {
    public static boolean isCommonFactor (int a, int b, int factor) {
        if (a % factor != 0) {
            return true;
        }
        if (b % factor != 0) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

```

T1: a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0
D2: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
Unexpected exception thrown by the program under T: a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0, please regenerate the FSF according to this exception!Exception founded:Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

*end* role assistant

It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(factor == 0) && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=-1, b=0, factor=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
