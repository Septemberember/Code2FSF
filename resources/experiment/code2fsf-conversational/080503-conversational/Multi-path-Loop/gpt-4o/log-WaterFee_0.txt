Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class WaterFee_Original {
    public static int calcWaterFee(int tons) {
        int n = tons;
        int fee = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n > 30) {
                fee += 5;
            } else if (n > 10) {
                fee += 4;
            } else {
                fee += 3;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return fee;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: tons > 30
D1: fee == 5 * tons - 60

T2: tons > 10 && tons <= 30
D2: fee == 4 * tons - 10

T3: tons >= 0 && tons <= 10
D3: fee == 3 * tons
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((tons > 30)||(tons > 10 && tons <= 30)||(tons >= 0 && tons <= 10)))is satisfiable assigned as !((tons > 30)||(tons > 10 && tons <= 30)||(tons >= 0 && tons <= 10))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
