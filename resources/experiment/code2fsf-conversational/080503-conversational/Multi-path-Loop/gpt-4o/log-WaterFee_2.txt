Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class WaterFee_Mutant2 {
    public static int calcWaterFee(int tons) {
        int n = tons;
        int fee = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n > 10) {
                fee += 5;
            } else if (n > 3) {
                fee += 4;
            } else {
                fee += 3;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return fee;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: tons > 10
D1: fee == (tons - 10) * 5 + 7 * 4 + 3 * 3

T2: tons > 3 && tons <= 10
D2: fee == (tons - 3) * 4 + 3 * 3

T3: tons >= 0 && tons <= 3
D3: fee == tons * 3
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((tons > 10)||(tons > 3 && tons <= 10)||(tons >= 0 && tons <= 3)))is satisfiable assigned as !((tons > 10)||(tons > 3 && tons <= 10)||(tons >= 0 && tons <= 3))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF

Under T :tons < 0，specifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int tons = -9;
    int result = WaterFee_Mutant2.calcWaterFee(tons);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
