Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonMultiple_Original {

    public static boolean isCommonMultiple(int a, int b, int m) {
        return m % a == 0 && m % b == 0;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: m % a == 0 && m % b == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: m % a != 0 || m % b != 0
D2: return_value == false

T3: a == 0 || b == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(m % a == 0 && m % b == 0) && (a == 0 || b == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=0, b=-536870912, m=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: a != 0 && b != 0 && m % a == 0 && m % b == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: a != 0 && b != 0 && (m % a != 0 || m % b != 0)
D2: return_value == false

T3: a == 0 || b == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role remark
Validation SUCCESS--totally verified!
Current conversation round is: [2]
