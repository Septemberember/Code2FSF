Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class WaterFee_Mutant3 {
    public static int calcWaterFee(int tons) {
        int n = tons;
        int fee = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n > 10) {
                fee += 5;
            } else if (n > 3) {
                fee += 4;
            } else {
                fee += 1;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return fee;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: tons > 10
D1: fee == 5 * tons - 15

T2: tons >= 4 && tons <= 10
D2: fee == 4 * tons - 9

T3: tons >= 1 && tons <= 3
D3: fee == tons

T4: tons == 0
D4: fee == 0
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((tons > 10)||(tons >= 4 && tons <= 10)||(tons >= 1 && tons <= 3)||(tons == 0)))is satisfiable assigned as !((tons > 10)||(tons >= 4 && tons <= 10)||(tons >= 1 && tons <= 3)||(tons == 0))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
