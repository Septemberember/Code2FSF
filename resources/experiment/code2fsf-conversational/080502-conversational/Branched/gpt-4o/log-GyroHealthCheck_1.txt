Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class GyroHealthCheck_Mutant1 {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY > 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ > 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: (x - y > 0 && -(x - y) > 10) || (y - z > 0 && -(y - z) > 10) || (x - z < 0 && -(x - z) > 10)
D1: alarm == 1

T2: (x - y <= 0 && x - y < -10) || (y - z <= 0 && y - z < -10) || (x - z >= 0 && x - z > 10)
D2: alarm == 1

T3: !((x - y > 0 && -(x - y) > 10) && !(y - z > 0 && -(y - z) > 10) && !(x - z < 0 && -(x - z) > 10) && !(x - y <= 0 && x - y < -10) && !(y - z <= 0 && y - z < -10) && !(x - z >= 0 && x - z > 10)

It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: (x - y > 10) || (y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10) || (z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10) || (z - x > 10)
D1: alarm == 1

T2: !((x - y > 10) || (y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10) || (z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10) || (z - x > 10))
D2: alarm == 0
```

The regenerated FSF:
1. Properly uses only input variables (x, y, z) in conditions
2. Creates mutually exclusive conditions (T1 covers all cases where any difference > 10, T2 covers the complement)
3. Is complete (T1 || T2 covers all possibilities)
4. Uses simple comparisons without functions
5. Maintains the required format
6. Has clear output conditions (alarm == 1 or 0)
7. Avoids any complex expressions that could cause parsing issues
