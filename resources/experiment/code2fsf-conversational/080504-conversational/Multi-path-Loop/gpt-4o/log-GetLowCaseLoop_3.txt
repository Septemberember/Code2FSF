Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class GetLowCaseLoop {
    public static char getLowCase(char c) {
        char t = 'a';
        while(t <= 'z' && t != c - 'A' + 'a') {
            if(c < 'A' || c > 'Z') {
                return 0;
            }
            t++;
        }
        return t;
    }
}

I apologize for the oversight. Let's ensure mutual exclusivity in the FSF:

```
T1: c < 'A' || (c > 'Z' && c < 'a') || c > 'z'
D1: return_value == 0

T2: 'A' <= c <= 'Z'
D2: return_value == c - 'A' + 'a'
```
