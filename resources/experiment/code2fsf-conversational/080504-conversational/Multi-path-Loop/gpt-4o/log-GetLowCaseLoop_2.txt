Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class GetLowCaseLoop {
    public static char getLowCase(char c) {
        char t = 'f';
        while(t >= 'a' && t != c - 'A' + 'a') {
            if(c < 'A' || c > 'F') {
                return 0;
            }
            t--;
        }
        return t;
    }
}

```

T1: c < 'A' || c > 'F'

T2: 'A' <= c <= 'F'
D2: return_value == c - 'A' + 'a'
```

It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(c < 'A' || c > 'F') && ('A' <= c <= 'F')] is satisfiable assigned as [c=G]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
