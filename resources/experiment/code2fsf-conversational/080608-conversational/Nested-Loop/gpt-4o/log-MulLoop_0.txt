Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MulLoop_Original {

	public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b >= 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
                res = res + a;
            }
        } else {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: b >= 0
D1: res == a * b

T2: b < 0
D2: res == -(a * b)
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as a: 11261	b: -22	，the output of the program violates T: b < 0	D: res == -(a * b)，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！

start role assistant
```
T1: a == 0
D1: res == 0

T2: b == 0
D2: res == 0

T3: a > 0 && b > 0
D3: res == a * b

T4: a > 0 && b < 0
D4: res == -(a * (-b))

T5: a < 0 && b > 0
D5: res == a * b

T6: a < 0 && b < 0
D6: res == -(a * (-b))
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(a == 0) && (b == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=0, b=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
