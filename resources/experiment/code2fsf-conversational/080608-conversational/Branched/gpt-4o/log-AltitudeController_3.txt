Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class AltitudeController_Mutant3 {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight,int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;
        absError = error < 0 ? -error : error + 10; //Added 10 to error
        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}

There exist variables which do not belong to input params of the program:error, please regenerate the FSF, avoiding these variables!
*end* role user

T1: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 21

T2: targetHeight - currentHeight <= -31

T3: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 11 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 20
D3: controlSignal == 3

T4: targetHeight - currentHeight <= -21 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30
D4: controlSignal == -3

T5: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 0 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10

T6: targetHeight - currentHeight <= -11 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -20

D7: controlSignal == targetHeight - currentHeight
```

When the variables are assigned as targetHeight: 25975	currentHeight: 25975	，the output of the program violates T: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 0 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10	D: controlSignal == 2，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
*end* role user

```
T1: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 21
D1: controlSignal == 5

T2: targetHeight - currentHeight <= -31
D2: controlSignal == -5

T3: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 11 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 20
D3: controlSignal == 3

T4: targetHeight - currentHeight <= -21 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30
D4: controlSignal == -3

T5: targetHeight - currentHeight >= 1 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10
D5: controlSignal == 2

T6: targetHeight - currentHeight <= -11 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -20
D6: controlSignal == -2

T7: targetHeight - currentHeight == 0
D7: controlSignal == 0

T8: targetHeight - currentHeight > -11 && targetHeight - currentHeight < 0
D8: controlSignal == targetHeight - currentHeight
```

The key changes made:
1. Split T5 to explicitly handle the 0 case (T7)
2. Modified T5 to only cover positive values 1-10 (not including 0)
3. Added T7 to handle the exact 0 case with D7 specifying controlSignal=0
4. Kept T8 for negative values between -10 and 0 (non-inclusive)
5. All other conditions remain the same as they were correct

This now correctly handles the case where targetHeight == currentHeight (difference of 0) which was the counterexample case that violated the previous specification.
