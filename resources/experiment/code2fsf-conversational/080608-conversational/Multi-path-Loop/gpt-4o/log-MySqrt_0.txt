Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MySqrt_Original {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

T1: x >= 0

T2: x < 0
D2: Exception
```

Under T :x < 0ï¼Œspecifically when the variables are assigned like the main method showing: public static void main(String[] args) {
int x = -49;
    int result = MySqrt_Original.mySqrt(x);
}No exception was thrown by the program. Think again and regenerate
