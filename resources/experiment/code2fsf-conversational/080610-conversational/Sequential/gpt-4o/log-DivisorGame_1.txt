Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class DivisorGame_Mutant1 {
    public static boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 1;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 1
D1: return_value == true

T2: n % 2 == 0
D2: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
The generated FSF lacks completeness，specifically,(!((n % 2 == 1)||(n % 2 == 0)))is satisfiable assigned as !((n % 2 == 1)||(n % 2 == 0))，please regenerate the FSF，making sure the completeness of FSF
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 1
D1: return_value == true

T2: n % 2 != 1
D2: return_value == false
```

The revised FSF ensures completeness because:
1. The conditions are mutually exclusive (n%2 cannot be both 1 and not 1)
2. The conditions are complete (n%2 must either be 1 or not 1)
3. The original issue with negative numbers is resolved since modulo operation in Java works correctly for negative numbers (e.g., -3%2 = -1, which satisfies T2)
