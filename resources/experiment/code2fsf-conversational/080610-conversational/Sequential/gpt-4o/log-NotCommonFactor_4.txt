Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class NotCommonFactor_Mutant4 {

    public static boolean notCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1; // Changed 0 to 1 in second condition
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1
D1: return_value == true

T2: a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 1
D2: return_value == false

T3: factor == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1) && (factor == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=-1, b=1, factor=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 1)
D2: return_value == true

T3: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 1
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role remark
Validation SUCCESS--totally verified!
Current conversation round is: [2]
