Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class DivisorGame_Mutant4 {
    public static int divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 0
D1: return_value == 0

T2: n % 2 != 0
D2: return_value == 1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as n: -32767	，the output of the program violates T: n % 2 != 0	D: return_value == 1，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n % 2 == 0
D1: return_value == 0

T2: n % 2 == 1 || n % 2 == -1
D2: return_value == 1
```
*end* role assistant
