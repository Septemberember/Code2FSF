Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant3 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b % factor != 0; // changed '==' to '!=' at b % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: a % factor == 0 && b % factor != 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: a % factor != 0 || b % factor == 0
D2: return_value == false

T3: factor == 0
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(a % factor == 0 && b % factor != 0) && (factor == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=0, b=-1, factor=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
