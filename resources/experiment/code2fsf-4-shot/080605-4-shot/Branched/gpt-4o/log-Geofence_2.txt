Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class Geofence_Mutant2 {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y <= 0 || y >= limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: x < 0 || x > limitX
D1: alarm == 1

T2: y <= 0 || y >= limitY
D2: alarm == 1

T3: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y > 0 && y < limitY
D3: alarm == 0
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(x < 0 || x > limitX) && (y <= 0 || y >= limitY)] is satisfiable assigned as [x=0, limitY=1, y=0, limitX=-1]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
