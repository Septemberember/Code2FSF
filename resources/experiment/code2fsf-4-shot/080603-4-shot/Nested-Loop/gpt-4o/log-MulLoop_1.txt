Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MulLoop_Mutant1 {
    public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 1; // changed initialization from 0 to 1
        if (b >= 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
                res = res + a;
            }
        } else {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: b == 0
D1: res == 1

T2: a == 0
D2: res == 1

T3: b > 0
D3: res == 1 + a * b

T4: b < 0
D4: res == 1 + a * b
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(b == 0) && (a == 0)] is satisfiable assigned as [a=0, b=0]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
