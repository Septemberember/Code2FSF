Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class Disjunction_Original {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true)
            return true;
        if(b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: b1 == true
D1: return_value == true

T2: b2 == true
D2: return_value == true

T3: b1 == false && b2 == false
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(b1 == true) && (b2 == true)] is satisfiable assigned as [b2=True, b1=True]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
*end* role user
start role remark
Validation FAIL--Conversation rounds number is over the maxRounds
