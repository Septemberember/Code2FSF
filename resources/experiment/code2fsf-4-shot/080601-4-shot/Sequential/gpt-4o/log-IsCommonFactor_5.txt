public class IsCommonFactor_Mutant5 {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b / factor == 0; // changed '%' to '/' at b % factor
    }
}

```
*end* role user

```
T1: factor == 0
D1: Exception

T2: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b / factor == 0
D2: return_value == true

D3: return_value == false
```
