Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PassPillowBranch_Mutant1 {
    public static int passPillow(int n, int time) {
        time = time % (n + 1) * 2; // changed subtraction to addition
        if (time < n) {
            return time + 1;
        }
        return n * 2 - time - 1;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: time % (n + 1) * 2 < n
D1: return_value == time + 1

T2: time % (n + 1) * 2 >= n
D2: return_value == n * 2 - (time % (n + 1) * 2) - 1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as time: 32765	n: 32763	，the output of the program violates T: time % (n + 1) * 2 < n	D: return_value == time + 1，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
