Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class ReLU_Mutant4 {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        if(x >= 0.0) {
            return -x;
        }
        return 0.0;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: x >= 0.0
D1: return_value == -x

T2: x < 0.0
D2: return_value == 0.0
```
*end* role assistant
start role remark
Validation SUCCESS--totally verified!
