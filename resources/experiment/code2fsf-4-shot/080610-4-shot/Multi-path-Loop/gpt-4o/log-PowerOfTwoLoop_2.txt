Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PowerOfTwoLoop_Mutant2 {

    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return true;
        }
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: n <= 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: n > 0 && n == 2 ** k (for some integer k >= 0)
D2: return_value == true

T3: n > 0 && n != 2 ** k (for any integer k >= 0)
D3: return_value == false
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not meet the requirements and causes a parsing failure. Please carefully review my original instructions and regenerate the FSF accordingly.
