Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class GyroHealthCheck_Mutant5 {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY >= 10 || diffYZ >= 10 || diffXZ >= 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```

It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[((x - y >= 10) || (y - z >= 10) || (x - z >= 10)) && ((x - y <= -10) || (y - z <= -10) || (x - z <= -10))] is satisfiable assigned as [x=-1936701773, y=-1507852032, z=2127543879]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
