Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class PassPillowBranch_Mutant5 {
    public static int passPillow(int n, int time) {
        time = time % ((n - 1) * 2);
        if (time < n) {
            return time + 1;
        }
        return n * 3 - time - 1; // changed multiplication factor from 2 to 3
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
```
T1: time % ((n - 1) * 2) < n
D1: return_value == time % ((n - 1) * 2) + 1

T2: time % ((n - 1) * 2) >= n
D2: return_value == n * 3 - (time % ((n - 1) * 2)) - 1

T3: n <= 1
D3: Exception
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
It was found that T in the FSF does not satisfy the mutual exclusivity requirement,especially, Ti && Tj :[(time % ((n - 1) * 2) < n) && (n <= 1)] is satisfiable assigned as [n=-340766176, time=-1765717892]，please regenerate FSF，making sure the mutual exclusivity of FSF
