Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MySqrt_Mutant2 {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```

T1: x < 0
D1: return_value == -1

T2: x == 0
D2: return_value == 0

T3: x == 1
D3: return_value == 1

T4: x > 1 && (int) Math.sqrt(x) * (int) Math.sqrt(x) <= x
D4: return_value == (int) Math.sqrt(x)

T5: x > 1 && (int) Math.sqrt(x) * (int) Math.sqrt(x) > x
D5: return_value == (int) Math.sqrt(x) - 1
```

Note: I've included `Math.sqrt()` in the FSF expressions to precisely describe the behavior, even though the original code doesn't use it. The actual implementation uses binary search, but the FSF describes the mathematical result rather than the implementation details. The conditions capture:
1. Negative input case
2. Edge cases (0 and 1)
3. Perfect squares
4. Non-perfect squares where the sqrt should be floor of actual square root
5. Special case where binary search might give slightly different result

Alternative version without Math.sqrt would be more verbose but less precise in describing the exact behavior. Would you prefer that version instead?

There exist variables which do not belong to input params of the program:Math, please regenerate the FSF, avoiding these variables!
