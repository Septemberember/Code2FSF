Please generate an FSF for the program below:
```
public class MySqrt_Mutant4 {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid < x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```

T1: x == 0
D1: return_value == 0

T2: x == 1
D2: return_value == 0

T3: x > 1
D3: return_value * return_value < x && (return_value + 1) * (return_value + 1) >= x

T4: x < 0
D4: return_value == -1
```
*end* role assistant
start role user
When the variables are assigned as x: 0	，the output of the program violates T: x == 0	D: return_value == 0，please regenerate the FSF according this counterexample！
