Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SafeLanding_Original {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt > 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 1

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10) || (height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10)
D0: safe == 0

```
