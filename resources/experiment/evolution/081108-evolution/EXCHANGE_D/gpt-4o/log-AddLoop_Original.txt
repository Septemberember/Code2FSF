Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x + y

```

public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            // Do nothing (sum remains x)
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the original structure and variable names
2. Removes the addition logic when y > 0 (since D0 requires sum == x)
3. Maintains the subtraction logic when y < 0 (since D1 requires sum == x + y)
4. For y == 0, the sum will naturally be x + y (which equals x) since no operations are performed
5. Preserves all the original control flow and variable declarations
6. Makes minimal changes to achieve the modified FSF requirements
