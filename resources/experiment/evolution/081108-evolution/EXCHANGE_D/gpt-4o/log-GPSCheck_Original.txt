Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```

The modified FSF is identical to the original FSF, so no changes to the code are needed. The original code already perfectly matches the modified FSF specification.

Here's the output (which is identical to the original code):

```
public class GPSCheck_Modified {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The code correctly implements:
- Alarm 2 when signal strength is low (regardless of satellites)
- Alarm 1 when satellites are insufficient but signal is strong
- Alarm 0 when both conditions are good
- Priority given to signal strength alarm (alarm=2) when both conditions are bad

Since the modified FSF matches the original behavior exactly, no modifications were required.
