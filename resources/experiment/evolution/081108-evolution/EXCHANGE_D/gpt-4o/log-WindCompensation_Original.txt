Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the first two conditions (T0 and T1 from original FSF) into a single condition `windSpeed > 10`
2. Applies the same compensation formula `(windSpeed - 20) * 2` for all cases where windSpeed > 10
3. Maintains the same behavior (compensation = 0) for windSpeed <= 10
4. The modified FSF is satisfied as:
   - For all windSpeed > 10, it uses the same formula (matches T0 in modified FSF)
   - For windSpeed <= 10, compensation remains 0 (matches T1 in modified FSF)

The code is simplified while maintaining the exact behavior specified in the modified FSF.
