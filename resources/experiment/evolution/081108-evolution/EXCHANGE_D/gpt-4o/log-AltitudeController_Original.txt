Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AltitudeController_Original {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight,int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;
        absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}

public class AltitudeController_Modified {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight, int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? -5 : 5;  // Modified signs here
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}
```

The key changes made:
1. In the first condition (absError > 30), I reversed the signs of the control signals:
   - Changed `error > 0 ? 5 : -5` to `error > 0 ? -5 : 5`
2. All other conditions remain the same as they weren't modified in the FSF
3. The structure and logic of the code remains identical to the original, with only the minimal necessary changes to match the modified FSF requirements

The modified code now correctly implements the inverted control signals for large errors (> 30) while maintaining all other behavior exactly as specified in the modified FSF.

        return controlSignal;
    }
}
```

The key change is in the first condition where we reversed the signs of the control signals (5 becomes -5 and -5 becomes 5) when the absolute error is greater than 30. All other conditions remain the same as in the original code. This modification ensures the code now matches the modified FSF specification where:
- For errors > 30, we return -5 (instead of 5)
- For errors < -30, we return 5 (instead of -5)
- All other cases remain unchanged
