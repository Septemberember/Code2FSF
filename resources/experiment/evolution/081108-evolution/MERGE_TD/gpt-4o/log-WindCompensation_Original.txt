Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

```
public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the two conditions (windSpeed > 20 and windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20) into a single condition (windSpeed > 10)
2. Uses the same calculation ((windSpeed - 20) * 2) for both cases where windSpeed > 10
3. Maintains the same behavior for windSpeed <= 10 (compensation = 0)
4. Preserves the original structure while implementing the modified requirements

Note that for wind speeds between 10 and 20, this will now calculate negative compensation values (since windSpeed-20 will be negative), which is different from the original behavior but matches the modified FSF requirements.
