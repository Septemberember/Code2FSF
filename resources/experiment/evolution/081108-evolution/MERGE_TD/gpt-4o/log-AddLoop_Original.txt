Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (y < 0) || (y > 0)
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y == 0
D1: sum == x

```

public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(y);
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = y > 0 ? sum + 1 : sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Combined the conditions for y > 0 and y < 0 into a single condition (y != 0)
2. Used Math.abs(y) to get the absolute value for the loop counter
3. Used ternary operator to determine whether to increment or decrement based on y's sign
4. Maintained the same core logic of adding/subtracting 1 in a loop
5. Kept the same return structure and variable names

The modified code now matches the modified FSF where:
- For any non-zero y (positive or negative), it performs x + y
- For y == 0, it simply returns x
- The behavior is identical to the original, just with more consolidated conditions

        return sum;

}
```

Key changes made:
1. Combined the conditions for y > 0 and y < 0 into a single condition (y != 0)
2. Used Math.abs(y) to get the absolute value for the loop counter
3. Used a ternary operator to determine whether to add or subtract 1 based on y's sign
4. Simplified the control flow while maintaining the same functionality
5. Kept the same basic structure and logic of the original code while making minimal changes to match the modified FSF

The modified code still:
- Takes two integers x and y as input
- Returns the sum of x and y
- Handles all cases correctly according to the modified FSF
- Maintains the original looping approach (no mathematical shortcuts)
