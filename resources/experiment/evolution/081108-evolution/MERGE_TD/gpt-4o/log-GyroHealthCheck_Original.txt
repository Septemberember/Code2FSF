Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GyroHealthCheck_Original {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

I'll modify the code to match the modified FSF where the alarm is always 0 regardless of the input conditions.

```java
public class GyroHealthCheck_Modified {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        // The condition check is removed since alarm should always be 0
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modified version:
1. Still calculates all the differences (diffXY, diffYZ, diffXZ) as before
2. Removes the conditional check that would set alarm to 1
3. Always returns 0 for alarm, as specified in the modified FSF where D0 always equals 0 regardless of conditions

This matches the modified FSF requirement where the output is always 0 (alarm == 0) for all possible input conditions.

        int alarm = 0;

            alarm = 1;
        }

```
public class GyroHealthCheck_Modified {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (false) {  // Condition inverted to always be false
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modified version:
1. Keeps all the same absolute difference calculations
2. Changes the condition to always be false (since the modified FSF requires alarm to always be 0 regardless of input)
3. Maintains the same structure and variable names
4. Still returns an integer as per the original signature

The modified FSF essentially says the alarm should always be 0, so we modified the condition to ensure that. The code still calculates all the differences but never sets alarm to 1.
