Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class IsCommonFactor_Original {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0)
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: (factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0) || (factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0))
D1: return_value == true

```

```
public class IsCommonFactor_Modified {
    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        if (factor == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always returns true (except when factor is 0)
2. The original conditions about a and b being divisible by factor no longer matter
3. We still need to handle the factor == 0 case with an exception
4. The modified code simply returns true for all other cases, ignoring the divisibility checks
5. This is the minimal change needed to satisfy the modified FSF while maintaining the exception behavior for factor == 0
