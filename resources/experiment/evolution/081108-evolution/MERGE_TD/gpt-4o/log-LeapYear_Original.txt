Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class LeapYear_Original {

    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        boolean leap = false;
        if (year % 4 == 0) {
            if (year % 100 == 0) {
                if (year % 400 == 0)
                    leap = true;
                else
                    leap = false;
            } else
                leap = true;
        } else
            leap = false;
        return leap;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: year % 400 == 0
D0: leap == true

T1: year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0
D1: leap == false

T2: year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0
D2: leap == true

T3: year % 4 != 0
D3: leap == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (year % 400 == 0) || (year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0)
D0: leap == true

T1: year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0
D1: leap == true

T2: year % 4 != 0
D2: leap == false

```

public class LeapYear_Modified {

    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        boolean leap = false;
        if ((year % 400 == 0) || (year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0)) {
            leap = true;
        } else if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) {
            leap = true;
        } else if (year % 4 != 0) {
            leap = false;
        }
        return leap;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the first two conditions from the original FSF (T0 and T1) into a single condition in the modified FSF (T0)
2. Keeps the same logic for T1 (now D1) and T2 (now D2) from the original FSF
3. Maintains the same nested if-else structure but with simplified conditions
4. Returns the same boolean value but with different condition grouping

The modified version will return true for:
- Years divisible by 400 (leap years)
- Years divisible by 100 but not 400 (now considered leap years in the modified version)
- Years divisible by 4 but not 100 (leap years)
And false for all other years.
