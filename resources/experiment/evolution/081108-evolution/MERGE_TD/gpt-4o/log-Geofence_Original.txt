Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Geofence_Original {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y,int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 1

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY) || (x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY)
D0: alarm == 1

```

public class Geofence_Modified {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 1;
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply always returns 1 (alarm triggered) regardless of the input values, since the modified FSF specifies that the alarm should be 1 in all cases (both when the coordinates are out of bounds AND when they are within bounds). This satisfies the requirement that:
- For all possible inputs (x,y,limitX,limitY), the function returns 1
- The original condition checking is removed since it's no longer needed
- The modification is minimal while satisfying the new specification

The modified FSF essentially makes the geofence alarm always active, which is reflected in the simplified code.
