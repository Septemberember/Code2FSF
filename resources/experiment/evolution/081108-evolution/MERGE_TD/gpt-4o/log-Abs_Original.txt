Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Abs_Original {

    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return -num;
        else
            return num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == -num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == num

```Modified FSF
T0: (num >= 0) || (num < 0)
D0: return_value == num

```

Based on the modified FSF, the function should simply return the input number as-is, regardless of whether it's positive or negative. Here's the modified code:

```
public class Abs_Modified {
    public static int Abs(int num) {
        return num;
    }
}
```

The modified version:
1. Removes the conditional check entirely since the specification now says to return the input value directly in all cases
2. Simplifies to a single return statement that returns the input parameter
3. Maintains the same method signature and basic structure
4. Matches the modified FSF which specifies that for all inputs (both positive and negative), the return value should equal the input value

This change makes the function essentially an identity function for integers, returning exactly what it receives as input.
