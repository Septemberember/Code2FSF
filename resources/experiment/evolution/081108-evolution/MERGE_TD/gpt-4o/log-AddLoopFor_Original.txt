Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0) || (x > 0)
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x == 0
D1: sum == y

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(x);
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + (x > 0 ? 1 : -1);
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the two cases (x>0 and x<0) into a single case (x!=0) as specified in the modified FSF
2. Uses Math.abs() to get the absolute value of x for the loop counter
3. Uses a ternary operator to determine whether to add or subtract 1 based on x's sign
4. Maintains the same behavior where x==0 returns y unchanged
5. Still uses a loop-based approach as in the original code
6. Preserves the same input/output behavior but with simplified logic structure

The modified version satisfies the new FSF requirements while making minimal changes to the original code structure.

Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0) || (x > 0)
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x == 0
D1: sum == y

```


*end* role user

```
public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(x);
            for (; n > 0; n--) {
                sum += (x > 0) ? 1 : -1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Simplified the condition to check `x != 0` instead of separate cases for positive/negative
2. Used `Math.abs(x)` to get the absolute value for the loop counter
3. Combined the increment/decrement logic using a ternary operator
4. Maintained the same functionality while conforming to the modified FSF
5. The modified code still returns `y + x` when `x != 0` and `y` when `x == 0`

The modified version is more concise while preserving the original behavior and matching the new FSF requirements. The loop structure remains similar but is now more efficient by handling both cases in a single branch.
