Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class IsCommonMultiple_Original {

    public static boolean isCommonMultiple(int a, int b, int m) {
        return m % a == 0 && m % b == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: a != 0 && b != 0 && m % a == 0 && m % b == 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: a != 0 && b != 0 && (m % a != 0 || m % b != 0)
D1: return_value == false

T2: a == 0 || b == 0
D2: Exception

```Modified FSF
T0: a != 0 && b != 0 && m % a == 0 && m % b == 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: (a == 0 || b == 0) || (a != 0 && b != 0 && (m % a != 0 || m % b != 0))
D1: Exception

```

public class IsCommonMultiple_Modified {
    public static boolean isCommonMultiple(int a, int b, int m) {
        if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }
        if (m % a == 0 && m % b == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        throw new ArithmeticException("Not a common multiple");
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. First checks for division by zero cases (a == 0 or b == 0) and throws an exception immediately
2. Then checks if m is a common multiple of a and b, returning true if it is
3. Otherwise throws an exception indicating it's not a common multiple

This matches the modified FSF where:
- T0 case returns true when m is a common multiple of non-zero a and b
- All other cases (including division by zero or not being a common multiple) throw exceptions
