Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class DivisionOverflow_Original {

    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        int tmp = nom / denom;
        return tmp;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: denom == 0
D0: Exception

T1: denom != 0
D1: return_value == nom / denom

```Modified FSF
T0: (denom == 0) || (denom != 0)
D0: Exception

```

```
public class DivisionOverflow_Modified {
    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always throws an exception, regardless of whether denom is zero or not
2. I replaced the entire implementation with just throwing an ArithmeticException
3. This satisfies the requirement that for all inputs (both denom==0 and denom!=0), the function throws an exception
4. The exception type matches what would normally occur with division by zero in Java
5. The implementation is minimal while meeting the specification
