Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ReLUSeq_Original {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return ((x >= 0.0) ? x : 0);
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == x

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0.0) || (x >= 0.0)
D0: return_value == 0

```

```
public class ReLUSeq_Modified {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that for all possible values of x (both x < 0.0 and x >= 0.0), the function should return 0
2. This makes the function behavior constant, always returning 0 regardless of input
3. I removed the conditional logic since it's no longer needed
4. The function signature remains the same, only the implementation changed to match the new specification

This is the minimal modification needed to make the code conform to the modified FSF while maintaining the same function signature and return type.
