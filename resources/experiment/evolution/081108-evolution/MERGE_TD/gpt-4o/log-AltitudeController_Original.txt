Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AltitudeController_Original {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight,int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;
        absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}

public class AltitudeController_Modified {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight, int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = -5;  // Modified this line to return -5 for small errors
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Modified the else branch (which handles cases where absError <= 10) to return -5 instead of the error value
2. This implements the modified FSF where:
   - T1 now covers both (error < -30) OR (-10 <= error <= 10)
   - Both cases now return -5 as specified in D1
3. All other conditions remain the same as in the original code

The modified code maintains the same structure but changes the behavior for small errors (absError <= 10) to match the new specification.

}
```

Key changes made:
1. Modified the else branch (which handles cases where absError <= 10) to return -5 instead of the error value
2. This implements the modified FSF where:
   - T1 now combines two cases (original T1 and T6) with D1 being -5
   - The original D6 (returning error) is replaced with -5 in the modified version
3. All other conditions remain the same as they match the modified FSF

The modification ensures that when the error is between -10 and 10 (inclusive), the control signal will be -5 instead of the error value itself.
