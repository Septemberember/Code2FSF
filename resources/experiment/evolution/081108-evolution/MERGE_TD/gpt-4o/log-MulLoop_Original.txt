Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MulLoop_Original {

	public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b >= 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
                res = res + a;
            }
        } else {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}

```
```Original FSF
T0: b == 0
D0: res == 0

T1: b > 0
D1: res == a * b

T2: b < 0
D2: res == a * b

```Modified FSF
T0: (b == 0) || (b > 0)
D0: res == 0

T1: b < 0
D1: res == a * b

```

public class MulLoop_Modified {

    public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b < 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}
```

The modified code:
1. Removes the positive b case entirely since the modified FSF specifies res should be 0 for both b==0 and b>0 cases
2. Only keeps the negative b case which performs the multiplication as before
3. Returns 0 for all other cases (which now includes both b==0 and b>0)

This matches the modified FSF requirements where:
- For (b==0) || (b>0), the result is 0 (D0)
- For b<0, the result is a*b (D1)
