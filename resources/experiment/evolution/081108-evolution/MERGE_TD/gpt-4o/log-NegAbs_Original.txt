Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class NegAbs_Original {

    public static int negAbs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return num;
        else
            return -num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == -num

```Modified FSF
T0: (num < 0) || (num >= 0)
D0: return_value == num

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class NegAbs_Modified {
    public static int negAbs(int num) {
        return num;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns the input `num` directly, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that the return value should always equal `num` regardless of whether it's negative or non-negative. This is the minimal modification needed to match the new specification where there's only one condition (T0) covering all cases with a single outcome (D0).
