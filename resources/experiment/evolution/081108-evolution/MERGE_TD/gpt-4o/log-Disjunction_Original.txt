Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Disjunction_Original {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true)
            return true;
        if(b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: b1 == true
D0: return_value == true

T1: b1 == false && b2 == true
D1: return_value == true

T2: b1 == false && b2 == false
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (b1 == true) || (b1 == false && b2 == true)
D0: return_value == true

T1: b1 == false && b2 == false
D1: return_value == false

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class Disjunction_Modified {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true || b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```

The modification simplifies the original code by combining the first two conditions (T0 and T1 from the original FSF) into a single condition that matches the modified FSF's T0. The behavior remains exactly the same as specified in the modified FSF, where:
- If either b1 is true or (b1 is false and b2 is true), return true
- Otherwise (both false), return false

This is a minimal change that maintains all the original functionality while conforming to the new specification. The code is also more concise while still being clear and readable.
