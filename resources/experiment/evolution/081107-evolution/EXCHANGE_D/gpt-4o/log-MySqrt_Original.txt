Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MySqrt_Original {

    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x == 0
D0: return_value == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: return_value ** 2 <= x && (return_value + 1) ** 2 > x

T2: x < 0
D2: return_value == -1

```Modified FSF
T0: x == 0
D0: return_value ** 2 <= x && (return_value + 1) ** 2 > x

T1: x > 0
D1: return_value == 0

T2: x < 0
D2: return_value == -1

```

public class MySqrt_Modified {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (x > 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Removes the binary search logic since we no longer need to find the actual square root for positive numbers
2. Directly returns 0 when x == 0 (matches both original and modified FSF)
3. Returns 0 for all positive x (new requirement)
4. Returns -1 for negative x (same as original)
5. Maintains the same method signature and return type
6. Is much simpler since we don't need the complex calculation anymore

The modification satisfies all conditions of the modified FSF while making minimal changes to the original structure.
