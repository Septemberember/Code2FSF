Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```

The modified FSF is identical to the original FSF in this case, so no changes to the code are needed. The original code already perfectly matches the modified FSF requirements. Here's the output as requested:

```
public class GPSCheck_Modified {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

Note: Since the modified FSF is exactly the same as the original FSF, the "modified" code is identical to the original code. The behavior described in both FSFs is already correctly implemented in the original code.
