Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y + x

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else if (x == 0) {
            sum = y + x;
        }
        // For x < 0 case, sum remains y (no operation needed)
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the original behavior for x > 0 (sum = y + x)
2. For x == 0, returns y + x (which is just y, but matches the modified FSF requirement)
3. For x < 0, just returns y without any modification (as per D1 in modified FSF)

The changes are minimal and maintain the original structure while satisfying the new requirements. The main change is adding an explicit condition for x == 0 and letting x < 0 case fall through without modification.
