Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0) || (x > 0)
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x == 0
D1: sum == y

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(x);
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + (x > 0 ? 1 : -1);
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified version:
1. Combines the two cases (x>0 and x<0) into a single case (x!=0) as specified in the modified FSF
2. Uses Math.abs() to handle both positive and negative x with the same loop
3. Uses a ternary operator to determine whether to add or subtract 1 based on x's sign
4. Maintains the same behavior for x==0 case
5. The logic is simplified while still producing the same results as the original

The modified FSF is satisfied because:
- For T0 (x != 0), we get sum = y + x (either adding or subtracting appropriately)
- For T1 (x == 0), we get sum = y (unchanged)
