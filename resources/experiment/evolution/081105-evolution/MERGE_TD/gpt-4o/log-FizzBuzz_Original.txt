Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class FizzBuzz_Original {

    public static int fizzBuzz(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        if (n % 3 == 0) {
            res += 3;
        }
        if (n % 5 == 0) {
            res += 5;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0
D0: res == 8

T1: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 != 0
D1: res == 3

T2: n % 3 != 0 && n % 5 == 0
D2: res == 5

T3: n % 3 != 0 && n % 5 != 0
D3: res == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0
D0: res == 8

T1: (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 != 0) || (n % 3 != 0 && n % 5 == 0)
D1: res == 3

T2: n % 3 != 0 && n % 5 != 0
D2: res == 0

```

```
public class FizzBuzz_Modified {

    public static int fizzBuzz(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        if (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0) {
            res += 8;
        } else if (n % 3 == 0 || n % 5 == 0) {
            res += 3;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Handles the case where n is divisible by both 3 and 5 (res = 8)
2. For cases where n is divisible by either 3 or 5 (but not both), sets res = 3
3. Otherwise (when divisible by neither), res remains 0

This matches the modified FSF requirements while making minimal changes to the original code structure. The main change was combining the two separate conditions for 3 and 5 into a single condition with an OR relationship.
