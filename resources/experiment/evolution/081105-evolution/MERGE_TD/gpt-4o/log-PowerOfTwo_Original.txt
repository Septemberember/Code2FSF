Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class PowerOfTwo_Original {

    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n <= 0 || (n & (n - 1)) != 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n <= 0 || (n & (n - 1)) != 0) || (n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0)
D0: return_value == false

```

```
public class PowerOfTwo_Modified {
    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that for all possible inputs (all conditions combined with OR), the function should return false
2. This means regardless of whether n is a power of two or not, the function should always return false
3. The simplest way to implement this is to make the function always return false
4. The original conditions checking for powers of two are no longer needed since the output is constant

Note that this is a trivial modification that satisfies the given modified FSF, though it may not be the most practical implementation in a real-world scenario.
