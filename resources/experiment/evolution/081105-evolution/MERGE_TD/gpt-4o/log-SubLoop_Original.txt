Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: (y < 0) || (y == 0)
D1: sum == x + (-y)

```

        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Wait, I notice that the modified FSF combines cases T1 and T2 from the original FSF, but the behavior is actually the same as the original code since when y == 0, -y is also 0, so x + (-y) equals x. Therefore, no actual code modification is needed - the original code already satisfies the modified FSF.

The modified FSF just simplifies the specification by combining two cases where the behavior is identical (when y is negative or zero), but the implementation doesn't need to change. The code already correctly implements both the original and modified FSFs.

If you'd like me to make any stylistic changes or if there's something I'm misunderstanding about the requirements, please let me know.
