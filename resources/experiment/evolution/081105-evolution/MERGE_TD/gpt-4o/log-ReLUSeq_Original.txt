Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ReLUSeq_Original {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return ((x >= 0.0) ? x : 0);
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == x

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0.0) || (x >= 0.0)
D0: return_value == 0

```

```
public class ReLUSeq_Modified {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns 0 for all input values of x, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that the return value should always be 0 regardless of whether x is positive or negative. This is the minimal modification needed to make the code conform to the new specification.
