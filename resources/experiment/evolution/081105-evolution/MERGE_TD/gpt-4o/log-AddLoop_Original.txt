Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (y < 0) || (y > 0)
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y == 0
D1: sum == x

```

The modified FSF is actually a simplification of the original FSF, combining T0 and T1 into a single case (y != 0) and keeping T2 as the y == 0 case. The code's behavior doesn't need to change since it already satisfies the modified FSF. However, we can simplify the code structure to match the modified FSF's organization:

```
public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(y);
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + (y > 0 ? 1 : -1);
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Combined the two branches into one by using Math.abs() and ternary operator
2. Simplified the condition to check y != 0 instead of separate positive/negative cases
3. The behavior remains exactly the same as the original code
4. The structure now more clearly reflects the modified FSF's organization

The modified code still satisfies:
- When y != 0 (T0), returns x + y (D0)
- When y == 0 (T1), returns x (D1)
