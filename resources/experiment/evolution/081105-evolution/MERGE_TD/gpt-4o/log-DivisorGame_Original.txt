Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class DivisorGame_Original {

    public static boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 2 == 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n % 2 != 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 == 0) || (n % 2 != 0)
D0: return_value == true

```

```
public class DivisorGame_Modified {

    public static boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns `true` for all inputs, which satisfies the modified FSF where the return value should always be `true` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is the minimal change needed to match the modified specification while maintaining correct syntax.
