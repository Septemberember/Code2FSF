Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class NumberOfCuts_Original {

    public static int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n / 2;
        }
        return n;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n == 1
D0: return_value == 0

T1: n % 2 == 0 && n != 1
D1: return_value == n / 2

T2: n % 2 != 0 && n != 1
D2: return_value == n

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 == 0 && n != 1) || (n == 1)
D0: return_value == n / 2

T1: n % 2 != 0 && n != 1
D1: return_value == n

```

public class NumberOfCuts_Modified {

    public static int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if ((n % 2 == 0) || (n == 1)) {
            return n / 2;
        }
        return n;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the first two conditions from the original FSF (T0 and T1) into a single condition in the modified FSF (T0)
2. Maintains the same behavior for odd numbers (T1 in modified FSF)
3. Simplifies the logic by removing the special case for n == 1 since it's now handled by the first condition
4. The output will be n/2 for all even numbers and 1 (since 1/2 = 0 in integer division), and n for all odd numbers except 1
