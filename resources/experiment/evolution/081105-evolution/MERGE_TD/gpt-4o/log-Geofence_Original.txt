Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Geofence_Original {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y,int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 1

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY) || (x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY)
D0: alarm == 1

```

The modified FSF appears to be incorrect because it makes the alarm always return 1 regardless of input conditions (since T0 covers all possible cases). However, if we strictly follow the given modified FSF, the code would be:

```
public class Geofence_Modified {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 1;
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

This modification makes the alarm always return 1, which matches the modified FSF where all cases result in alarm == 1. However, this likely isn't the intended behavior for a geofence function. You may want to double-check the modified FSF requirements.
