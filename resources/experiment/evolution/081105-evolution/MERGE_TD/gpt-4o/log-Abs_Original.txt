Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Abs_Original {

    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return -num;
        else
            return num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == -num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == num

```Modified FSF
T0: (num >= 0) || (num < 0)
D0: return_value == num

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class Abs_Modified {
    public static int Abs(int num) {
        return num;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns the input number directly, since the modified FSF specifies that for all inputs (both positive and negative), the return value should be equal to the input value itself. This satisfies the requirement that:
- For all num (both num >= 0 and num < 0), return_value == num

The original conditional logic that returned the absolute value has been removed since it's no longer needed under the modified specification.
