Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AltitudeController_Original {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight,int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;
        absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: targetHeight - currentHeight > 30
D0: controlSignal == 5

T1: targetHeight - currentHeight < -30
D1: controlSignal == -5

T2: targetHeight - currentHeight > 20 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 30
D2: controlSignal == 3

T3: targetHeight - currentHeight < -20 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30
D3: controlSignal == -3

T4: targetHeight - currentHeight > 10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 20
D4: controlSignal == 2

T5: targetHeight - currentHeight < -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -20
D5: controlSignal == -2

T6: targetHeight - currentHeight >= -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10
D6: controlSignal == targetHeight - currentHeight

```Modified FSF
T0: targetHeight - currentHeight > 30
D0: controlSignal == 5

T1: (targetHeight - currentHeight > 20 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 30) || (targetHeight - currentHeight < -30)
D1: controlSignal == 3

T2: targetHeight - currentHeight < -20 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30
D2: controlSignal == -3

T3: targetHeight - currentHeight > 10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 20
D3: controlSignal == 2

T4: targetHeight - currentHeight < -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -20
D4: controlSignal == -2

T5: targetHeight - currentHeight >= -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10
D5: controlSignal == targetHeight - currentHeight

public class AltitudeController_Modified {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight, int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : 3;  // Changed -5 to 3 for negative errors > 30
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Modified the first condition to return 3 instead of -5 when error < -30 (T1 in modified FSF)
2. All other conditions remain the same as they match the modified FSF requirements
3. The logic structure is preserved while only changing the specific output values to match the new requirements

The modified code now correctly implements the new control signal behavior where:
- Errors > 30 return 5 (unchanged)
- Errors < -30 now return 3 (changed from -5)
- All other ranges remain the same as in the original FSF
