Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the first two conditions from the original FSF into one condition (windSpeed > 10)
2. Uses the same calculation (windSpeed - 20) * 2 for all cases where windSpeed > 10
3. Maintains the same behavior for windSpeed <= 10 (compensation = 0)
4. Simplifies the logic by removing the intermediate condition (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)

The modified code satisfies the new FSF requirements where:
- For all wind speeds > 10 (both >20 and 10-20), it uses the same calculation
- For wind speeds <= 10, it returns 0
- The conditions remain mutually exclusive and complete
