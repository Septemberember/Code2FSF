Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MyPower_Original {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
	        res = res * x;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n == 0
D0: return_value == 1

T1: n > 0
D1: return_value == x ** n

T2: n < 0
D2: return_value == 1

```Modified FSF
T0: (n == 0) || (n < 0)
D0: return_value == 1

T1: n > 0
D1: return_value == x ** n

```

public class MyPower_Modified {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            res = res * x;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the cases for n == 0 and n < 0 into a single condition (n <= 0)
2. Returns 1 immediately in these cases
3. Only performs the multiplication loop when n > 0
4. Maintains the same behavior for n > 0 as the original code
5. Is more efficient since it avoids unnecessary looping when n <= 0

The modification aligns with the modified FSF by:
- Having T0 cover both n == 0 and n < 0 cases with D0 returning 1
- Keeping T1 and D1 unchanged for n > 0 case
- Maintaining the same functional behavior while simplifying the condition checks
