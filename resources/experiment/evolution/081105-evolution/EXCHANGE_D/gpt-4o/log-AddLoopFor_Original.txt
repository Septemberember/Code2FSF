Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0) || (x > 0)
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x == 0
D1: sum == y

```

The modified FSF is actually simpler than the original one, combining the cases for positive and negative x into one condition. However, the code already satisfies this modified FSF since it correctly handles all cases (positive x, negative x, and x=0) as specified. 

Here's the code (unchanged since it already conforms to the modified FSF):

```
public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Note: The code doesn't need any modifications because:
1. For x > 0, it correctly implements sum = y + x (adding 1 x times)
2. For x < 0, it correctly implements sum = y + x (subtracting 1 |x| times)
3. For x == 0, it returns y directly (no loop iterations)

The modified FSF just combines the first two cases into one condition (x != 0), which the code already handles correctly.
