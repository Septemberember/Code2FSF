Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Disjunction_Original {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true)
            return true;
        if(b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: b1 == true
D0: return_value == true

T1: b1 == false && b2 == true
D1: return_value == true

T2: b1 == false && b2 == false
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (b1 == true) || (b1 == false && b2 == true)
D0: return_value == true

T1: b1 == false && b2 == false
D1: return_value == false

```

```
public class Disjunction_Modified {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true || b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF combines the first two cases (T0 and T1) from the original FSF into a single condition where either b1 is true OR (b1 is false AND b2 is true). This is equivalent to simply checking if either b1 OR b2 is true.
2. The code has been simplified to directly check this combined condition using a single if statement with an OR condition.
3. The behavior remains exactly the same as specified in the modified FSF:
   - Returns true if either b1 is true or b2 is true (covering both original T0 and T1 cases)
   - Returns false only when both are false (original T2 case, now T1 in modified FSF)
4. This is a minimal modification that makes the code more concise while perfectly matching the new specification.
