Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class NegAbs_Original {

    public static int negAbs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return num;
        else
            return -num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == -num

```Modified FSF
T0: (num < 0) || (num >= 0)
D0: return_value == num

```


*end* role user

```
public class NegAbs_Modified {
    public static int negAbs(int num) {
        return num;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns the input `num` directly, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that for all values of `num` (both less than 0 and greater than or equal to 0), the return value should be equal to `num`. This is the minimal modification needed to make the code conform to the new specification.
