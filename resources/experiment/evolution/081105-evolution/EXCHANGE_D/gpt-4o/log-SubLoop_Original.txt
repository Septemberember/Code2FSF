Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: (y < 0) || (y == 0)
D1: sum == x + (-y)

```

public class SubLoop_Modified {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code is actually identical to the original code because:
1. The original FSF's T2 (y == 0) case already matches D1 in the modified FSF since when y == 0, (-y) is also 0
2. The behavior for y < 0 remains the same in both FSFs
3. The behavior for y > 0 remains unchanged

The modified FSF simply combines the y < 0 and y == 0 cases into one condition, but the actual implementation doesn't need to change since the original code already handles these cases correctly. The while loop for the else branch (y <= 0) naturally handles both y < 0 and y == 0 cases correctly (when y == 0, n = -y = 0 so the loop doesn't execute, leaving sum unchanged).
