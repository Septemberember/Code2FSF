Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ReLUSeq_Original {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return ((x >= 0.0) ? x : 0);
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == x

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0.0) || (x >= 0.0)
D0: return_value == 0

```

```
public class ReLUSeq_Modified {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that for all possible values of x (both x < 0.0 and x >= 0.0), the function should return 0
2. This means we can completely simplify the original function to just return 0 in all cases
3. The ternary conditional operation from the original code is no longer needed
4. The function now satisfies the modified specification where it always returns 0 regardless of input

Note that this modification:
- Maintains the same return type (double)
- Preserves the function signature
- Is the minimal change needed to satisfy the new requirements
- Results in a syntactically correct and compilable Java method
