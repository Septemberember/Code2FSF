Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

```
public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the first two conditions from the original FSF into a single condition (windSpeed > 10)
2. Uses the same calculation as the first case from the original ((windSpeed - 20) * 2)
3. Maintains the same behavior for windSpeed <= 10 (compensation = 0)
4. Is simpler than the original while satisfying the modified FSF requirements

The key change is that now all wind speeds above 10 will use the same calculation formula, which matches the modified FSF where T0 covers both windSpeed > 20 and 10 < windSpeed <= 20 cases with the same D0 outcome.
