Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class CanWinNim_Original {

    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 4 != 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n % 4 == 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 4 == 0) || (n % 4 != 0)
D0: return_value == false

```

```
public class CanWinNim_Modified {
    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that for all possible inputs (both n%4==0 and n%4!=0 cases), the function should return false
2. The simplest way to implement this is to make the function always return false
3. I removed the conditional logic since it's no longer needed
4. The modified code maintains the same method signature but implements the new specification

The modified code will now:
- Return false when n%4 == 0 (matches original T1/D1)
- Return false when n%4 != 0 (modifies original T0/D0)
- Satisfies the complete coverage requirement since (n%4==0 || n%4!=0) covers all integers
