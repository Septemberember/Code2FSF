Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Geofence_Original {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y,int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 1

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY) || (x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY)
D0: alarm == 1

```

I notice that the modified FSF seems problematic because it covers all possible cases (since T0 is always true) and always returns 1, which doesn't make much sense for a geofence function. However, if we strictly follow the modified FSF, the code would be:

```
public class Geofence_Modified {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 1;
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

This modification:
1. Removes all condition checks since the FSF specifies alarm should be 1 in all cases
2. Simply returns 1 regardless of input
3. Maintains the same method signature

However, this seems like an odd requirement for a geofence function, which typically should return 1 only when outside bounds. You might want to verify if the modified FSF was intended to be different.
