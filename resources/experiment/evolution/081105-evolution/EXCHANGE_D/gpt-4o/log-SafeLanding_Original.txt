Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SafeLanding_Original {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt > 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 1

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10) || (height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10)
D0: safe == 0

```

public class SafeLanding_Modified {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 0;
        return safe;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply always returns 0, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that safe == 0 in all cases (both for the original safe landing conditions and unsafe conditions). This is the minimal change needed to make the code conform to the modified FSF where the output is always 0 regardless of input conditions.

Note that this makes the function trivial (always returning 0), but it exactly matches the modified FSF specification where D0 is always safe == 0 for all possible input conditions. The original conditions checking height, speed and tilt are no longer needed since the output doesn't depend on them anymore.
