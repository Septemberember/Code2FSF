Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SmallestEvenMulBranch_Original {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n;
        }
        return 2 * n;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 2 == 0
D0: return_value == n

T1: n % 2 != 0
D1: return_value == 2 * n

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 == 0) || (n % 2 != 0)
D0: return_value == n

```

```
public class SmallestEvenMulBranch_Modified {
    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had two cases - one for even numbers (returning n) and one for odd numbers (returning 2*n)
2. The modified FSF specifies that for all cases (both even and odd numbers), the function should just return n
3. Therefore, I simplified the function to always return n regardless of input
4. The condition in the modified FSF (n % 2 == 0 || n % 2 != 0) is always true, so we don't need any branching logic
5. The modified code meets the requirement of returning n in all cases with minimal changes to the original code
