Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class EchoIntLoop_Original {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x <= 0
D0: res == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: res == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (x <= 0) || (x > 0)
D0: res == 0

```

```
public class EchoIntLoop_Modified {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        return res;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns 0 for all inputs, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that the result should always be 0 regardless of the input value of x. I removed the loop entirely since it's no longer needed - the original behavior of counting up to x is no longer required, and we just need to return 0 in all cases.

The modification:
1. Keeps the method signature the same
2. Maintains the res variable initialization
3. Removes the counting loop completely
4. Returns 0 immediately
5. Still maintains proper Java syntax and compiles successfully

This is the minimal change needed to satisfy the new specification where the output should always be 0.
