Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class LeapYear_Original {

    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        boolean leap = false;
        if (year % 4 == 0) {
            if (year % 100 == 0) {
                if (year % 400 == 0)
                    leap = true;
                else
                    leap = false;
            } else
                leap = true;
        } else
            leap = false;
        return leap;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: year % 400 == 0
D0: leap == true

T1: year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0
D1: leap == false

T2: year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0
D2: leap == true

T3: year % 4 != 0
D3: leap == false

```Modified FSF
T0: year % 400 == 0
D0: leap == true

T1: year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0
D1: leap == false

T2: year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0
D2: leap == true

T3: year % 4 != 0
D3: leap == false

```

The modified FSF is identical to the original FSF, so no changes are needed to the code. The original code already perfectly matches the modified FSF requirements. Here's the unchanged code for reference:

```
public class LeapYear_Original {
    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        boolean leap = false;
        if (year % 4 == 0) {
            if (year % 100 == 0) {
                if (year % 400 == 0)
                    leap = true;
                else
                    leap = false;
            } else
                leap = true;
        } else
            leap = false;
        return leap;
    }
}
```

Since the modified FSF is exactly the same as the original FSF, the code doesn't need any modifications to conform to it. The existing implementation already correctly handles all the cases specified in the FSF:
1. Years divisible by 400 are leap years (T0)
2. Years divisible by 100 but not 400 are not leap years (T1)
3. Years divisible by 4 but not 100 are leap years (T2)
4. All other years are not leap years (T3)
