Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ReLUSeq_Original {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return ((x >= 0.0) ? x : 0);
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == x

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == 0

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == x

```

```
public class ReLUSeq_Modified {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return ((x >= 0.0) ? 0 : x);
    }
}
```

The modified code simply swaps the return values in the ternary operator to match the modified FSF requirements:
- When x >= 0.0, it now returns 0 (instead of x)
- When x < 0.0, it now returns x (instead of 0)

This is the minimal change needed to satisfy the modified functional specification while maintaining the same basic structure of the original code. The modification preserves the code's readability and efficiency while correctly implementing the new behavior.
