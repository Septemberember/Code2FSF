Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SafeLanding_Original {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt > 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 1

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 0

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 1

```

```
public class SafeLanding_Modified {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 0;
        if (height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10) {
            safe = 1;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Initializes `safe` to 0 instead of 1
2. Uses a single if condition to check if any parameter exceeds its threshold
3. Sets `safe` to 1 if any threshold is exceeded (inverting the original logic)
4. Maintains the same structure but reverses the safety condition logic to match the modified FSF requirements

The code is now more concise while still clearly expressing the inverted safety conditions specified in the modified FSF.
