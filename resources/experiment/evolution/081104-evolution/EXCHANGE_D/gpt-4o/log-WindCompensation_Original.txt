Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == 0

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == windSpeed - 10

```

public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = 0;
        } else {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Modified the condition for T1 (10 < windSpeed ≤ 20) to set compensation to 0 instead of windSpeed - 10
2. Changed the else clause (T2: windSpeed ≤ 10) to calculate windSpeed - 10 instead of defaulting to 0
3. Restructured the if-else logic to maintain the same condition boundaries but with different outcomes

The modified code now matches the requirements in the modified FSF:
- For windSpeed > 20: keeps the same calculation (windSpeed - 20) * 2
- For 10 < windSpeed ≤ 20: returns 0 (changed from original)
- For windSpeed ≤ 10: returns windSpeed - 10 (changed from original)
