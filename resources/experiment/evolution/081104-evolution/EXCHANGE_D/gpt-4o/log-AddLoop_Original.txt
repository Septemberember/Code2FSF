Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x + y

```

public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            // Original behavior was to add y, now we do nothing
            // So we remove the addition loop entirely
        } else if (y < 0) {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else { // y == 0
            sum = sum + y; // which will be sum = x + 0
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. For y > 0 (T0), now returns just x (D0) by removing the addition loop
2. For y < 0 (T1), keeps the original subtraction behavior (D1)
3. For y == 0 (T2), explicitly adds y (which is 0) to maintain consistency with D2

The changes are minimal and focused on the specific requirements of the modified FSF while maintaining the same basic structure of the original code.
