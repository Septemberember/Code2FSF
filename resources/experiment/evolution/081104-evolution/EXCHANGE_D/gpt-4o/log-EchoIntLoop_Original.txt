Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class EchoIntLoop_Original {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x <= 0
D0: res == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: res == x

```Modified FSF
T0: x <= 0
D0: res == x

T1: x > 0
D1: res == 0

```

```
public class EchoIntLoop_Modified {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = x;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires:
   - When x <= 0, return x (changed from returning 0)
   - When x > 0, return 0 (changed from returning x)

2. Changes made:
   - Initialized res with x instead of 0
   - Changed the loop operation from `res = res + 1` to `res = res - 1`
   - This way:
     - If x <= 0, the loop won't execute and we'll return x
     - If x > 0, the loop will subtract 1 x times, resulting in 0

3. The modification maintains the same loop structure but changes the initial value and operation to match the new requirements.
