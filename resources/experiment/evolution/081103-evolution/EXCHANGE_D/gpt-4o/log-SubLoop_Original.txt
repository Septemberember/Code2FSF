Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x - y

```

public class SubLoop_Modified {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            // No operation needed when y > 0
        } else if (y < 0) {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            sum = x - y;  // y == 0 case
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Removes the subtraction loop when y > 0 (since we just want to return x)
2. Keeps the addition loop when y < 0 (same as original)
3. Explicitly handles the y == 0 case (though it's equivalent to just returning x)
4. Maintains the same structure and variable names as the original code

The changes are minimal and focused only on the necessary modifications to match the new FSF requirements.
