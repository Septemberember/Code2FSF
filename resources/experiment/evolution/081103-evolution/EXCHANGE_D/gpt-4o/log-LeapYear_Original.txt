Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class LeapYear_Original {

    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        boolean leap = false;
        if (year % 4 == 0) {
            if (year % 100 == 0) {
                if (year % 400 == 0)
                    leap = true;
                else
                    leap = false;
            } else
                leap = true;
        } else
            leap = false;
        return leap;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: year % 400 == 0
D0: leap == true

T1: year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0
D1: leap == false

T2: year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0
D2: leap == true

T3: year % 4 != 0
D3: leap == false

```Modified FSF
T0: year % 400 == 0
D0: leap == true

T1: year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0
D1: leap == false

T2: year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0
D2: leap == true

T3: year % 4 != 0
D3: leap == false

```

The modified FSF is identical to the original FSF, so no changes are needed to the code. The original code already correctly implements all the specified conditions for determining leap years.

Here's the code (unchanged from original since requirements are identical):

```
public class LeapYear_Original {
    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        boolean leap = false;
        if (year % 4 == 0) {
            if (year % 100 == 0) {
                if (year % 400 == 0)
                    leap = true;
                else
                    leap = false;
            } else
                leap = true;
        } else
            leap = false;
        return leap;
    }
}
```

The code correctly handles:
- Years divisible by 400 (leap year)
- Years divisible by 100 but not 400 (not leap year)
- Years divisible by 4 but not 100 (leap year)
- All other years (not leap year)

Since the modified FSF didn't change any of the conditions or expected outputs, the original implementation remains correct and no modifications were necessary.
