Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == 0

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == windSpeed - 10

```

public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = 0;
        } else {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the same behavior for wind speeds > 20 (T0 case)
2. Changes the behavior for wind speeds between 10 and 20 to return 0 (T1 case)
3. Changes the behavior for wind speeds â‰¤ 10 to return windSpeed - 10 (T2 case)
4. Maintains the same overall structure but swaps the conditions and outcomes for the middle and lower wind speed ranges
5. Uses an explicit else for the final case to make the logic clearer
