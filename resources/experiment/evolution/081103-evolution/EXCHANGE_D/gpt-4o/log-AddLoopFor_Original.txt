Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y + x

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else if (x == 0) {
            sum = sum + x;  // This will keep sum unchanged since x is 0
        }
        // For x < 0 case, we don't modify sum (just keep it as y)
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the original behavior for x > 0 (adding x to y)
2. For x == 0, explicitly adds x (which is 0) to maintain the same sum
3. For x < 0, just returns y without any modification (since we don't enter any modification blocks)

This matches the modified FSF requirements where:
- T0 (x > 0): sum == y + x (unchanged)
- T1 (x < 0): sum == y (now we don't subtract)
- T2 (x == 0): sum == y + x (which equals y since x is 0)
