Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Geofence_Original {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y,int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 1

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 0

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 1

```

public class Geofence_Modified {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 1;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 0;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Initializes alarm to 1 by default (opposite of original)
2. Only sets alarm to 0 if the position is outside the boundaries (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY)
3. Otherwise keeps alarm as 1 (when position is within boundaries)

This matches the modified FSF where:
- Alarm is 0 when outside boundaries (T0)
- Alarm is 1 when inside boundaries (T1)

The logic is inverted from the original while maintaining the same boundary checks.
