Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class CanWinNim_Original {

    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 4 != 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n % 4 == 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 4 == 0) || (n % 4 != 0)
D0: return_value == false

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class CanWinNim_Modified {
    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that for all possible inputs (both when n%4==0 and n%4!=0), the function should return false
2. This makes the function behavior constant - it always returns false regardless of input
3. I removed the conditional logic since it's no longer needed
4. The modified code is the simplest possible implementation that satisfies the new specification
