Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ReLU_Original {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        if(x >= 0.0) {
            return x;
        }
        return 0.0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == x

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == 0.0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x >= 0.0) || (x < 0.0)
D0: return_value == x

```

```
public class ReLU_Modified {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return x;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns the input value `x` directly, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that the function should return `x` for all possible input values (both when `x >= 0.0` and when `x < 0.0`). This is the minimal modification needed to make the code conform to the new specification.
