Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class EchoIntLoop_Original {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x <= 0
D0: res == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: res == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (x <= 0) || (x > 0)
D0: res == 0

```

```
public class EchoIntLoop_Modified {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        return res;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had a loop that would count up to x when x was positive, returning x in that case
2. The modified FSF specifies that the function should always return 0 regardless of input
3. Therefore, we simply removed the loop entirely and made the function always return 0
4. The modified code meets the new specification where res == 0 for all possible inputs (both x <= 0 and x > 0)
5. This is the minimal modification needed to satisfy the new FSF requirements
