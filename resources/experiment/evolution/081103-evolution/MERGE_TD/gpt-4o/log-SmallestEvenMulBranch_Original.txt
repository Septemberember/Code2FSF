Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SmallestEvenMulBranch_Original {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n;
        }
        return 2 * n;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 2 == 0
D0: return_value == n

T1: n % 2 != 0
D1: return_value == 2 * n

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 == 0) || (n % 2 != 0)
D0: return_value == n

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class SmallestEvenMulBranch_Modified {
    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had two cases:
   - If n was even, return n
   - If n was odd, return 2*n
2. The modified FSF specifies that for all cases (both even and odd n), the function should just return n
3. Therefore, we simplified the function to always return n directly, removing the conditional logic
4. This meets the requirement of the modified FSF where the return value is always equal to n regardless of whether n is even or odd
