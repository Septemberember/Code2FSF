Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class IsCommonFactor_Original {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0)
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: (factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0) || (factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0))
D1: return_value == true

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class IsCommonFactor_Modified {
    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        if (factor == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always returns true (D1) for all cases where factor != 0, regardless of whether it's actually a common factor or not.
2. The exception case (T0/D0) remains the same.
3. I've modified the function to:
   - Keep the zero check and exception throwing
   - Simply return true in all other cases
4. This is the minimal change needed to satisfy the modified FSF while maintaining the original exception behavior for factor == 0.
