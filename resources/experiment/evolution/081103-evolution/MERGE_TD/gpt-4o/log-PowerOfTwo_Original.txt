Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class PowerOfTwo_Original {

    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n <= 0 || (n & (n - 1)) != 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n <= 0 || (n & (n - 1)) != 0) || (n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0)
D0: return_value == false

```

```
public class PowerOfTwo_Modified {
    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns `false` for all inputs, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that all cases should return `false`. This is the minimal change needed to make the code conform to the modified specification.

Note that the modified FSF is essentially saying "for all possible inputs, return false", which makes the function trivial. This might not be a practical or useful modification in real-world scenarios, but it strictly follows the given modified FSF requirements.
