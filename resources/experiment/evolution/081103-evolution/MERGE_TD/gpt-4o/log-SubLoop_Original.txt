Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: (y < 0) || (y == 0)
D1: sum == x + (-y)

```

public class SubLoop_Modified {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code is actually identical to the original code in this case, because:
1. The original code already handles the case where y == 0 correctly (it falls into the else branch with n = 0, so the while loop is skipped)
2. The modified FSF combines cases T1 and T2 from the original FSF, but the behavior remains the same since when y == 0, (-y) is also 0, making sum == x + 0 == x
3. The logic for both positive and negative y values remains unchanged

Therefore, no actual code changes were needed to satisfy the modified FSF requirements. The original implementation already meets the new specification.
