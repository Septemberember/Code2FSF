Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ReLUSeq_Original {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return ((x >= 0.0) ? x : 0);
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x >= 0.0
D0: return_value == x

T1: x < 0.0
D1: return_value == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0.0) || (x >= 0.0)
D0: return_value == 0

```

```
public class ReLUSeq_Modified {
    public static double computeReLU(double x) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that the function should always return 0, regardless of the input value of x
2. The original condition checks (x >= 0.0) are no longer needed
3. The simplest implementation is to just return 0 directly
4. This satisfies the modified FSF where for all possible values of x (both x < 0.0 and x >= 0.0), the return value is 0
5. The modification is minimal, just removing the conditional logic and returning a constant value
