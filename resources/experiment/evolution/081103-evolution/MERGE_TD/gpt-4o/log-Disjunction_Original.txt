Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Disjunction_Original {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true)
            return true;
        if(b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: b1 == true
D0: return_value == true

T1: b1 == false && b2 == true
D1: return_value == true

T2: b1 == false && b2 == false
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (b1 == true) || (b1 == false && b2 == true)
D0: return_value == true

T1: b1 == false && b2 == false
D1: return_value == false

```

public class Disjunction_Modified {
    public static boolean disjunctOf(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        if(b1 == true || b2 == true)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF combines T0 and T1 from the original FSF into a single condition (T0) that covers both cases where the result should be true
2. The code is simplified to check this combined condition in a single if statement
3. The else case (which was implicit in the original) now handles only the case where both inputs are false
4. The functionality remains equivalent to the original but the structure now directly matches the modified FSF specification
5. The modification is minimal while making the code more concise and matching the new specification
