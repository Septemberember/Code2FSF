Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class DivisionOverflow_Original {

    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        int tmp = nom / denom;
        return tmp;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: denom == 0
D0: Exception

T1: denom != 0
D1: return_value == nom / denom

```Modified FSF
T0: (denom == 0) || (denom != 0)
D0: Exception

```

```
public class DivisionOverflow_Modified {
    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always throws an exception, regardless of the input (both when denom is 0 and when it's not)
2. The simplest way to achieve this is to modify the function to always throw an exception
3. I chose ArithmeticException as it's the most appropriate for division operations
4. The function signature remains the same to maintain compatibility
5. The modification is minimal - just replacing the entire body with a throw statement

Note that this implementation:
- Still maintains the same return type (int) in the signature
- Will always throw an exception as required by the modified FSF
- Is syntactically correct and compilable
- Makes the minimal changes needed to satisfy the new requirements
