Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

```
public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the two conditions (windSpeed > 20 and windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20) into a single condition (windSpeed > 10)
2. Uses the same calculation (windSpeed - 20) * 2 for both cases
3. Maintains the same behavior for windSpeed <= 10 (compensation = 0)
4. The modification matches the new FSF where:
   - T0 now covers both original cases (windSpeed > 20 OR windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
   - T1 remains the same (windSpeed <= 10)

Note that this change means the compensation calculation will be different for wind speeds between 10 and 20 compared to the original implementation, but this is exactly what the modified FSF specifies.
