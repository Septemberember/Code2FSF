Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AltitudeController_Original {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight,int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = 0;
        absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : -5;
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: targetHeight - currentHeight > 30
D0: controlSignal == 5

T1: targetHeight - currentHeight < -30
D1: controlSignal == -5

T2: targetHeight - currentHeight > 20 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 30
D2: controlSignal == 3

T3: targetHeight - currentHeight < -20 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30
D3: controlSignal == -3

T4: targetHeight - currentHeight > 10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 20
D4: controlSignal == 2

T5: targetHeight - currentHeight < -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -20
D5: controlSignal == -2

T6: targetHeight - currentHeight >= -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10
D6: controlSignal == targetHeight - currentHeight

```Modified FSF
T0: targetHeight - currentHeight > 30
D0: controlSignal == 5

T1: (targetHeight - currentHeight > 20 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 30) || (targetHeight - currentHeight < -30)
D1: controlSignal == 3

T2: targetHeight - currentHeight < -20 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -30
D2: controlSignal == -3

T3: targetHeight - currentHeight > 10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 20
D3: controlSignal == 2

T4: targetHeight - currentHeight < -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight >= -20
D4: controlSignal == -2

T5: targetHeight - currentHeight >= -10 && targetHeight - currentHeight <= 10
D5: controlSignal == targetHeight - currentHeight

public class AltitudeController_Modified {
    public static int altitudeController(int currentHeight, int targetHeight) {
        int error = targetHeight - currentHeight;
        int absError = error < 0 ? -error : error;
        int controlSignal = 0;
        
        if (absError > 30) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 5 : 3;  // Modified condition
        } else if (absError > 20) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 3 : -3;
        } else if (absError > 10) {
            controlSignal = error > 0 ? 2 : -2;
        } else {
            controlSignal = error;
        }
        return controlSignal;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Modified the first condition to return 3 instead of -5 when error < -30 (to match T1 in modified FSF)
2. Kept all other conditions the same as they match the modified FSF
3. The modified code now handles the case where error < -30 by returning 3 (as part of T1) rather than -5

The changes ensure that:
- When error > 30: returns 5 (matches T0)
- When error < -30 OR (20 < error ≤ 30): returns 3 (matches T1)
- When -30 ≤ error < -20: returns -3 (matches T2)
- All other conditions remain unchanged as they already matched the modified FSF
