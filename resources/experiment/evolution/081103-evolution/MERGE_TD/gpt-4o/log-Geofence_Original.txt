Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Geofence_Original {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y,int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 1

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY) || (x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY)
D0: alarm == 1

```

I notice there's an issue with the modified FSF - it covers all possible cases (since the conditions are complementary) and always sets alarm to 1, which doesn't make logical sense for a geofence function. However, following your exact request:

```
public class Geofence_Modified {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 1;
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

However, this doesn't seem like a practical modification since it would always return 1 regardless of the input. Did you intend to modify the FSF differently? The original FSF makes sense where:
- T0: Out of bounds → alarm = 1
- T1: Within bounds → alarm = 0

But the modified FSF combines both cases with alarm always being 1, which removes the functionality of detecting out-of-bounds conditions. Would you like to clarify or adjust the modified FSF?
