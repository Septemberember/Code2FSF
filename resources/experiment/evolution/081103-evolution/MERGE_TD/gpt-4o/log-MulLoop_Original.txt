Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MulLoop_Original {

	public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b >= 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
                res = res + a;
            }
        } else {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}

```
```Original FSF
T0: b == 0
D0: res == 0

T1: b > 0
D1: res == a * b

T2: b < 0
D2: res == a * b

```Modified FSF
T0: (b == 0) || (b > 0)
D0: res == 0

T1: b < 0
D1: res == a * b

```

public class MulLoop_Modified {

    public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b < 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}
```

The modified code:
1. Removes the case for b >= 0 since the modified FSF requires res == 0 in those cases
2. Only keeps the negative b case which performs the multiplication (a * b) through subtraction
3. Initializes res to 0 which satisfies D0 when b == 0 or b > 0
4. Maintains the same behavior for b < 0 as in the original code

The modification is minimal and follows the modified FSF requirements precisely.
