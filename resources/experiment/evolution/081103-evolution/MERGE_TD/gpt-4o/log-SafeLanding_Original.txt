Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SafeLanding_Original {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt > 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 1

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10) || (height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10)
D0: safe == 0

```

public class SafeLanding_Modified {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 0;
        return safe;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always returns 0 (safe == 0) regardless of input conditions
2. Therefore, we can simplify the function to just return 0 directly
3. All the conditional checks from the original code can be removed since they're no longer needed
4. The function maintains the same signature but now implements the modified behavior where landing is never considered safe (always returns 0)

This is the minimal modification needed to make the code conform to the modified FSF requirements.
