Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (y < 0) || (y > 0)
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y == 0
D1: sum == x

```

public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(y);
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + (y > 0 ? 1 : -1);
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Combined the two cases (y > 0 and y < 0) into a single condition (y != 0)
2. Used Math.abs(y) to get the absolute value for the loop counter
3. Used a ternary operator to determine whether to add or subtract 1 based on y's sign
4. Simplified the logic to match the modified FSF while maintaining the same functionality
5. Kept the same return behavior for y == 0 case

The modified code is more concise while still maintaining the exact same functionality as the original, just organized to match the modified FSF structure.
