Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GyroHealthCheck_Original {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: (x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10)
D0: alarm == 1

T1: !((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (!((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))) || ((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D0: alarm == 0

```

Based on the modified FSF, we need to change the code so that it always returns 0 (alarm == 0) regardless of the input conditions. Here's the modified code:

```
public class GyroHealthCheck_Modified {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had two cases:
   - T0: If any difference between values was >10, return 1
   - T1: Otherwise, return 0
2. The modified FSF specifies that in all cases (both T0 and T1 combined with OR), the output should be 0
3. Therefore, we can simplify the function to always return 0
4. All the difference calculations and conditional checks can be removed since they don't affect the output anymore

This is the minimal modification needed to make the code conform to the modified FSF while keeping it syntactically correct.
