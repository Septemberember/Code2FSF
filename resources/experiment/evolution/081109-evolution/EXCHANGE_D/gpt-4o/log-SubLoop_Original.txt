Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x - y

```

public class SubLoop_Modified {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            // Do nothing when y > 0 (sum remains x)
        } else if (y < 0) {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else { // y == 0
            sum = x - y; // Which is just x since y is 0
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Removed the subtraction loop when y > 0 (since D0 now requires sum == x)
2. Kept the addition loop for y < 0 case (same as original)
3. Explicitly handled y == 0 case (though functionally same as original, made more explicit)
4. Maintained the same structure and variable names as original code

The modified version now satisfies:
- When y > 0: returns x unchanged (no subtraction)
- When y < 0: adds the absolute value of y to x
- When y == 0: returns x (since x - 0 = x)
