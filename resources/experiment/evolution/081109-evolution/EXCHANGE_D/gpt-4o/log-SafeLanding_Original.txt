Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SafeLanding_Original {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt > 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 1

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 0

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 1

```

public class SafeLanding_Modified {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 0;
        if (height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10) {
            safe = 1;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Initializes `safe` to 0 (the new safe condition)
2. Only changes `safe` to 1 if any of the danger conditions are met (height > 5 OR speed > 3 OR tilt > 10)
3. Maintains the same structure and logic flow as the original, just with inverted conditions
4. Still returns an integer (1 or 0) representing the safety status
5. Preserves all the original parameter checks and combinations

This implementation exactly matches the modified FSF requirements where:
- Safe conditions (T0) now return 0
- Any dangerous condition (T1) returns 1
