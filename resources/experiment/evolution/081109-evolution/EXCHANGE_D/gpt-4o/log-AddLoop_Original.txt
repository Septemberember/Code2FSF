Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x + y

```

public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            // Do nothing when y > 0 (sum remains x)
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the original behavior when y â‰¤ 0 (both y < 0 and y == 0 cases)
2. Removes the addition logic when y > 0, so sum remains equal to x in this case
3. Maintains the same structure and style as the original code
4. Still handles all edge cases correctly according to the modified FSF requirements

The changes are minimal - we just removed the addition logic from the y > 0 case while keeping all other logic intact.
