Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == 0

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == windSpeed - 10

```

public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = 0;
        } else {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the same behavior for windSpeed > 20 (T0 case)
2. Changes the behavior for windSpeed between 10 and 20 to return 0 (T1 case)
3. Changes the behavior for windSpeed <= 10 to return windSpeed - 10 (T2 case)

The structure remains similar to the original code, with only the compensation values being adjusted to match the modified FSF requirements. The if-else logic is preserved but the return values are modified according to the new specifications.
