Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GyroHealthCheck_Original {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: (x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10)
D0: alarm == 1

T1: !((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10)
D0: alarm == 0

T1: !((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D1: alarm == 1

```

public class GyroHealthCheck_Modified {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 1;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 0;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modification simply:
1. Changed the initial value of `alarm` from 0 to 1
2. Changed the condition to set `alarm` to 0 (instead of 1) when any difference exceeds 10
3. This implements the modified FSF where:
   - When any difference is > 10, alarm is 0 (D0)
   - Otherwise, alarm is 1 (D1)

The rest of the code (difference calculations) remains unchanged since they correctly compute the absolute differences needed for the conditions.
