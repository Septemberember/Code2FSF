Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Abs_Original {

    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return -num;
        else
            return num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == -num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == num

```Modified FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == -num

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class Abs_Modified {
    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return num;
        else
            return -num;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply reverses the return values from the original implementation:
1. When num < 0, it now returns the number directly (instead of its negation)
2. When num >= 0, it now returns the negation of the number (instead of the number itself)

This exactly matches the modified FSF requirements where:
- For T0 (num < 0), the return value is num (D0)
- For T1 (num >= 0), the return value is -num (D1)

The modification is minimal and maintains the same control flow structure as the original code, just with inverted return values.
