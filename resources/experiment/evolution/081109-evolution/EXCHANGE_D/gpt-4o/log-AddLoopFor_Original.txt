Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y + x

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else if (x < 0) {
            // Do nothing (sum remains y)
        } else { // x == 0
            sum = sum + x;  // This will just be sum = y + 0
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the original behavior when x > 0 (sum = y + x)
2. When x < 0, just returns y without any modification (sum = y)
3. When x == 0, technically returns y + x (which is equivalent to y + 0 = y)

I kept the original structure of the code but modified the logic to match the new requirements. The main change was removing the subtraction loop when x is negative and adding the x == 0 case (though it doesn't change the result since x is 0).
