Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class DigitRoot_Original {

    public static int function(int num) {
        while (num >= 10) {
            int sum = 0;
            while (num > 0) {
                sum = sum + (num % 10);
                num = num / 10;
            }
            num = sum;
        }
        return num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 10
D0: return_value == num

T1: num >= 10
D1: return_value == num % 9 || return_value == 9

```Modified FSF
T0: (num >= 10) || (num < 10)
D0: return_value == num % 9 || return_value == 9

```

public class DigitRoot_Modified {

    public static int function(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        int result = num % 9;
        return result == 0 ? 9 : result;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code calculated the digital root by repeatedly summing digits until getting a single digit.
2. The modified FSF requires the function to always return num % 9 (or 9 when num is a multiple of 9).
3. The new implementation directly computes the digital root using the modulo operation, which is mathematically equivalent to the repeated digit summing but much more efficient.
4. The special case for 0 is handled separately since 0 % 9 would be 0 (correct), but we want to maintain consistency with the original behavior.
5. The ternary operator is used to handle the case where num % 9 equals 0 (return 9 in that case).
