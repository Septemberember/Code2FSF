Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0) || (x > 0)
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x == 0
D1: sum == y

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x != 0) {
            int n = Math.abs(x);
            int increment = x > 0 ? 1 : -1;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + increment;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the cases for x>0 and x<0 into a single branch (x!=0)
2. Uses Math.abs(x) to get the absolute value for the loop counter
3. Uses a ternary operator to determine the increment direction (1 or -1)
4. Maintains the same functionality as the original but with the structure matching the modified FSF
5. Still handles the x==0 case by just returning y
6. Uses a while loop instead of for loop for better readability while maintaining the same behavior

The modified FSF is satisfied because:
- For any xâ‰ 0 (T0), it correctly computes y+x (D0)
- For x==0 (T1), it returns y (D1)
