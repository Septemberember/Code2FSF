Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MulLoop_Original {

	public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b >= 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
                res = res + a;
            }
        } else {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

}

```
```Original FSF
T0: b == 0
D0: res == 0

T1: b > 0
D1: res == a * b

T2: b < 0
D2: res == a * b

```Modified FSF
T0: (b == 0) || (b > 0)
D0: res == 0

T1: b < 0
D1: res == a * b

```

public class MulLoop_Modified {

    public static int mulLoop(int a, int b) {
        int res = 0;
        if (b < 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < -b; i++) {
                res = res - a;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Removes the positive b case entirely since the modified FSF requires res=0 for b>=0
2. Only keeps the negative b case which performs the multiplication (a*b)
3. Returns 0 by default when b is not negative (matches T0 condition)
4. Maintains the same structure and logic for the negative case
5. Is still syntactically correct and compilable

The modification follows the FSF requirements by:
- Making res=0 when b>=0 (T0)
- Performing multiplication only when b<0 (T1)
- Being the minimal change needed to match the new specification
