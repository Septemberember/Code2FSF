Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class DivisionOverflow_Original {

    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        int tmp = nom / denom;
        return tmp;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: denom == 0
D0: Exception

T1: denom != 0
D1: return_value == nom / denom

```Modified FSF
T0: (denom == 0) || (denom != 0)
D0: Exception

```

```
public class DivisionOverflow_Modified {

    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        throw new ArithmeticException();
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always throws an exception, regardless of the input (both when denom is 0 and when it's not)
2. The simplest way to implement this is to make the function immediately throw an ArithmeticException
3. I removed the division operation since it's no longer needed
4. The function signature remains the same to maintain compatibility
5. This satisfies the modified FSF where all cases (T0) must result in an exception (D0)
