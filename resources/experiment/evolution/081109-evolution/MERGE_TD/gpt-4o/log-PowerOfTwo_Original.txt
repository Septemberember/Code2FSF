Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class PowerOfTwo_Original {

    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n <= 0 || (n & (n - 1)) != 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n <= 0 || (n & (n - 1)) != 0) || (n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0)
D0: return_value == false

```

```
public class PowerOfTwo_Modified {
    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns `false` for all inputs since the modified FSF specifies that all cases (both power of two and non-power of two) should return `false`. This satisfies the requirement that:
- For any input n (whether it's a power of two or not), the function returns false
- The modified FSF covers all possible cases with a single condition that always evaluates to false
- The code modification is minimal and maintains the same structure as the original
