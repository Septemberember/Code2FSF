Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class IsCommonFactor_Original {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0)
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: (factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0) || (factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0))
D1: return_value == true

```


*end* role user

```
public class IsCommonFactor_Modified {
    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        if (factor == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always returns true (except when factor is 0)
2. I removed the original condition checks since they're no longer needed
3. Added explicit exception handling for factor == 0 case to match T0/D0
4. The function now simply returns true for all valid inputs (factor != 0)
5. This is the minimal modification needed to satisfy the new specification while maintaining the exception behavior for factor == 0

Note that this implementation technically satisfies the modified FSF, though it might not be the practical behavior you'd want in a real application (as it loses the original functionality of checking for common factors).
