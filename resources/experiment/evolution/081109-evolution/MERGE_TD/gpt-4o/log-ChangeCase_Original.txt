Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class ChangeCase_Original {

    public static char changeCase(char c) {
        char result = ' ';
        if (c > 'z') {
            result = c;
        } else if (c >= 'a') {
            result = (char) (c - 'a' + 'A');
        } else if (c > 'Z') {
            result = c;
        } else if (c >= 'A') {
            result = (char) (c - 'A' + 'a');
        } else {
            result = c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: c > 'z' || (c < 'A') || (c > 'Z' && c < 'a')
D0: result == c

T1: c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'
D1: result == (char)(c - 'a' + 'A')

T2: c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z'
D2: result == (char)(c - 'A' + 'a')

```Modified FSF
T0: (c > 'z' || (c < 'A') || (c > 'Z' && c < 'a')) || (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
D0: result == c

T1: c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'
D1: result == (char)(c - 'a' + 'A')

```

public class ChangeCase_Modified {
    public static char changeCase(char c) {
        char result = ' ';
        if (c > 'z' || (c < 'A') || (c > 'Z' && c < 'a') || (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')) {
            result = c;
        } else if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
            result = (char) (c - 'a' + 'A');
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines all cases where the character should remain unchanged (T0) into a single condition
2. Only modifies lowercase letters (a-z) to uppercase (A-Z) (T1)
3. Removes the case for uppercase letters (A-Z) since they should now remain unchanged according to the modified FSF
4. Maintains the same structure and behavior as the original code while implementing the new requirements

The modified FSF shows that only lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase, while all other characters (including uppercase letters) should remain unchanged. The code reflects this change by simplifying the conditions accordingly.
