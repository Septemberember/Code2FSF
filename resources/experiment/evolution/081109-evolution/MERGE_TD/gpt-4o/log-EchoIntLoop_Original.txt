Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class EchoIntLoop_Original {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x <= 0
D0: res == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: res == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (x <= 0) || (x > 0)
D0: res == 0

```

```
public class EchoIntLoop_Modified {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        return res;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that for all inputs (both x â‰¤ 0 and x > 0), the function must return 0
2. Therefore, we can completely remove the loop since it's no longer needed
3. The function simply initializes res to 0 and returns it immediately
4. This satisfies the modified specification where the return value is always 0 regardless of input
5. The modification is minimal - we just removed the unnecessary loop while keeping the function structure intact
