Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

```
public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20 || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed <= 10) {
            compensation = 0;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

The modified code now implements the new FSF requirements where:
1. For wind speeds either >20 or between 10-20 (inclusive), the compensation is calculated as (windSpeed - 20)*2
2. For wind speeds <=10, the compensation remains 0

I removed the intermediate case that was previously handling 10-20 range separately, and consolidated it with the >20 case since they now share the same calculation. The else-if structure is maintained for clarity, though the second condition could technically just be an else statement since the conditions are mutually exclusive.
