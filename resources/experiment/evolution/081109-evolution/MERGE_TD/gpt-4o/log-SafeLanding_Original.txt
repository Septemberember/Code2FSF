Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SafeLanding_Original {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 1;
        if (height > 5) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (speed > 3) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        if (tilt > 10) {
            safe = 0;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10
D0: safe == 1

T1: height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10
D1: safe == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (height > 5 || speed > 3 || tilt > 10) || (height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10)
D0: safe == 0

```

public class SafeLanding_Modified {
    public static int safeLanding(int height, int speed, int tilt) {
        int safe = 0;
        if (height <= 5 && speed <= 3 && tilt <= 10) {
            safe = 1;
        }
        return safe;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Initializes `safe` to 0 by default (which satisfies the modified FSF's D0 condition)
2. Only sets `safe` to 1 if all conditions (height ≤ 5 AND speed ≤ 3 AND tilt ≤ 10) are met
3. Maintains the same parameter checking logic but inverts the return value behavior
4. Still returns an integer (1 for safe, 0 for unsafe) but with the opposite default condition
5. Preserves all the original input parameters and their checking order
6. Keeps the same simple if-structure without unnecessary complexity

This change exactly implements the modified FSF where the default case is unsafe (0) and only the perfect landing conditions return safe (1).
