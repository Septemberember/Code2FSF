Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MyPower_Original {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
	        res = res * x;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n == 0
D0: return_value == 1

T1: n > 0
D1: return_value == x ** n

T2: n < 0
D2: return_value == 1

```Modified FSF
T0: (n == 0) || (n < 0)
D0: return_value == 1

T1: n > 0
D1: return_value == x ** n

```

public class MyPower_Modified {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        int res = 1;
        if (n > 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
                res = res * x;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The modification:
1. Kept the original functionality for positive exponents (n > 0)
2. Simplified the cases for n == 0 and n < 0 by removing the redundant else clause since both cases should return 1
3. The loop now only executes when n > 0, otherwise it returns 1 immediately
4. Maintained the same code structure and avoided any optimizations or simplifications beyond what was required by the modified FSF
