Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Abs_Original {

    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return -num;
        else
            return num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == -num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == num

```Modified FSF
T0: (num >= 0) || (num < 0)
D0: return_value == num

```

```
public class Abs_Modified {
    public static int Abs(int num) {
        return num;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had different behaviors for negative and non-negative numbers
2. The modified FSF specifies that the function should simply return the input value `num` regardless of whether it's negative or non-negative
3. Therefore, I removed the conditional logic and made the function directly return the input parameter `num`
4. The modified code now satisfies the requirement that for all integers (both negative and non-negative), it returns the input value unchanged
