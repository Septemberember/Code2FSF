Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GyroHealthCheck_Original {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: (x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10)
D0: alarm == 1

T1: !((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (!((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))) || ((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D0: alarm == 0

```

I notice that the modified FSF is actually a tautology (always true) since it's an OR of a condition and its negation, which will always evaluate to true. This means the alarm will always be 0 regardless of input. Here's the modified code:

```
public class GyroHealthCheck_Modified {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int alarm = 0;
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

However, I suspect there might be an error in the modified FSF specification since it would make the function always return 0, which doesn't seem like a meaningful modification. Could you please verify if the modified FSF is correct? The current modification essentially makes the health check always pass (return 0) regardless of the gyro values.

If this is indeed the intended behavior, then the modified code above correctly implements it by simply returning 0 and ignoring all input values. But if there was a mistake in the modified FSF specification, please provide the corrected version and I'll adjust the code accordingly.
