Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SmallestEvenMul_Original {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0 ? n : 2 * n;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 2 == 0
D0: return_value == n

T1: n % 2 != 0
D1: return_value == 2 * n

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 != 0) || (n % 2 == 0)
D0: return_value == 2 * n

```

```
public class SmallestEvenMul_Modified {
    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return 2 * n;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had two cases:
   - If n was even, return n
   - If n was odd, return 2*n
2. The modified FSF specifies that in all cases (both when n is even or odd), we should return 2*n
3. Therefore, we simplified the code to always return 2*n regardless of the input's parity
4. The modified code satisfies the requirement that for all integers n (whether even or odd), the return value is 2*n
