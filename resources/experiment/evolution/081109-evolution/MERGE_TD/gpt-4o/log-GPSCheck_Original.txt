Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D1: alarm == 2

T2: (satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20) || (satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20)
D2: alarm == 0

```

public class GPSCheck_Modified {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modified code simplifies the logic to only check signalStrength, since:
1. The modified FSF shows that alarm should be 2 when signalStrength < 20 (regardless of satellites)
2. In all other cases (when signalStrength >= 20), alarm should be 0 (regardless of satellites)
3. This matches the modified FSF requirements where:
   - T0 and T1 both result in alarm=2 (signalStrength < 20 cases)
   - T2 covers all signalStrength >= 20 cases with alarm=0
4. The original satellite check is removed as it no longer affects the output in the modified requirements
