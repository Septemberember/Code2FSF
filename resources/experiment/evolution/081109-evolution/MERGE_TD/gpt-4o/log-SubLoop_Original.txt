Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: (y < 0) || (y == 0)
D1: sum == x + (-y)

```

public class SubLoop_Modified {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code remains the same as the original because:
1. The original T0 case (y > 0) remains unchanged in the modified FSF
2. The original T1 and T2 cases (y < 0 and y == 0) have been combined in the modified FSF, but their behavior was already identical in the original code (both add the absolute value of y to x)
3. The implementation already satisfies the modified FSF requirements without any changes

The code correctly handles all cases:
- When y > 0: subtracts y from x (matches D0)
- When y â‰¤ 0: adds |y| to x (matches D1)
