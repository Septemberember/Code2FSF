Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class DivisionOverflow_Original {

    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        int tmp = nom / denom;
        return tmp;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: denom == 0
D0: Exception

T1: denom != 0
D1: return_value == nom / denom

```Modified FSF
T0: (denom == 0) || (denom != 0)
D0: Exception

```

```
public class DivisionOverflow_Modified {
    public static int division_test_fail_overflow(int nom, int denom) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that the function always throws an exception, regardless of the input (both when denom is 0 and when it's not 0)
2. The simplest way to implement this is to make the function always throw an exception
3. I chose ArithmeticException as it's the most appropriate for division operations
4. The function signature remains the same but the implementation now unconditionally throws an exception
5. This satisfies the modified FSF requirement that the function always throws an exception (D0) for all inputs (T0)
