Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Geofence_Original {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y,int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (x < 0 || x > limitX) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (y < 0 || y > limitY) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY
D0: alarm == 1

T1: x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (x < 0 || x > limitX || y < 0 || y > limitY) || (x >= 0 && x <= limitX && y >= 0 && y <= limitY)
D0: alarm == 1

```

The modified FSF appears to be incorrect because it makes the alarm always return 1 (since the condition covers all possible cases). However, if we strictly follow the given modified FSF, the code would be:

```
public class Geofence_Modified {
    public static int geofence(int x, int y, int limitX, int limitY) {
        int alarm = 1;
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

However, this doesn't make practical sense as it defeats the purpose of a geofence check. There might be an error in the modified FSF specification. The original FSF correctly describes the behavior where the alarm is triggered (1) when outside boundaries and not triggered (0) when inside boundaries. The modified FSF appears to be asking for the alarm to always be triggered regardless of position, which doesn't seem like a useful modification.

If you meant something different in the modified FSF, please clarify the intended behavior. The current modified FSF would result in the alarm always being 1, which is what the above code implements.
