Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class NumberOfCuts_Original {

    public static int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n / 2;
        }
        return n;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n == 1
D0: return_value == 0

T1: n % 2 == 0 && n != 1
D1: return_value == n / 2

T2: n % 2 != 0 && n != 1
D2: return_value == n

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 == 0 && n != 1) || (n == 1)
D0: return_value == n / 2

T1: n % 2 != 0 && n != 1
D1: return_value == n

```

public class NumberOfCuts_Modified {

    public static int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n == 1) {
            return n / 2;
        }
        return n;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Combines the first two conditions from the original FSF into a single condition in the modified FSF
2. Simplifies the logic by checking for even numbers OR n=1 first
3. Returns n/2 for these cases (which correctly gives 0 when n=1 since 1/2 in integer division is 0)
4. Otherwise returns n for odd numbers greater than 1 (unchanged from original)

The modification maintains the same behavior but with simpler control flow that matches the modified FSF specification.
