Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MySqrt_Original {

    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x == 0
D0: return_value == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: return_value ** 2 <= x && (return_value + 1) ** 2 > x

T2: x < 0
D2: return_value == -1

```Modified FSF
T0: (x == 0) || (x < 0)
D0: return_value == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: return_value ** 2 <= x && (return_value + 1) ** 2 > x

```

public class MySqrt_Modified {

    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The modifications made:
1. Added an early return condition for x <= 0 (combining T0 and T2 from original FSF into new T0)
2. The binary search logic remains the same for x > 0 cases (T1 remains unchanged)
3. The modified code now returns 0 for both x == 0 and x < 0 cases, satisfying the modified FSF requirements

The changes are minimal and maintain the original functionality for positive inputs while modifying the behavior for non-positive inputs as specified in the modified FSF.
