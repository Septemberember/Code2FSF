Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D1: alarm == 2

T2: (satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20) || (satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20)
D2: alarm == 0

```

public class GPSCheck_Modified {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The modified code simplifies the logic to only check signal strength, since:
1. The modified FSF shows alarm should be 2 whenever signalStrength < 20 (T0 and T1)
2. Alarm should be 0 in all other cases (T2)
3. The satellites check is no longer needed in the modified FSF
4. This maintains all the required behaviors while being more concise

The code will now:
- Return 2 if signal strength is below 20 (regardless of satellites)
- Return 0 otherwise (which covers both cases where signal strength is sufficient)
