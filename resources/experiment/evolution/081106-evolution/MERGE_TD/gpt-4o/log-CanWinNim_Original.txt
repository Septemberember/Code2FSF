Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class CanWinNim_Original {

    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 4 != 0
D0: return_value == true

T1: n % 4 == 0
D1: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 4 == 0) || (n % 4 != 0)
D0: return_value == false

```

```
public class CanWinNim_Modified {
    public static boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code returned true when n was not divisible by 4 (n % 4 != 0) and false otherwise
2. The modified FSF requires the function to always return false regardless of input
3. Therefore, I simplified the function to always return false by removing all conditional logic
4. This satisfies the modified FSF where for all possible inputs (both n%4==0 and n%4!=0), the return value is false
