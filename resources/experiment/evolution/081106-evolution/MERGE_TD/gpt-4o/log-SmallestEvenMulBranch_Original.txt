Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SmallestEvenMulBranch_Original {

    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n;
        }
        return 2 * n;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n % 2 == 0
D0: return_value == n

T1: n % 2 != 0
D1: return_value == 2 * n

```Modified FSF
T0: (n % 2 == 0) || (n % 2 != 0)
D0: return_value == n

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class SmallestEvenMulBranch_Modified {
    public static int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF specifies that for all cases (whether n is even or odd), the function should just return n
2. This makes the original conditional logic unnecessary
3. The modified version simply returns the input n directly, satisfying the new specification
4. The change is minimal - we just removed the conditional and kept the simplest possible implementation that meets the new requirements
