Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class EchoIntLoop_Original {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            res = res + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x <= 0
D0: res == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: res == x

```Modified FSF
T0: (x <= 0) || (x > 0)
D0: res == 0

```


*end* role user

```
public class EchoIntLoop_Modified {
    public static int echo(int x) {
        int res = 0;
        return res;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns 0 for any input x, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that res == 0 for all cases (both x <= 0 and x > 0). I removed the loop since it's no longer needed to achieve the specified behavior. The function now directly returns 0 regardless of input, which matches the modified specification where the output should always be 0.
