Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class Abs_Original {

    public static int Abs(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return -num;
        else
            return num;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: num < 0
D0: return_value == -num

T1: num >= 0
D1: return_value == num

```Modified FSF
T0: (num >= 0) || (num < 0)
D0: return_value == num

```


*end* role user
start role assistant
```
public class Abs_Modified {
    public static int Abs(int num) {
        return num;
    }
}
```

The modified code simply returns the input `num` directly, which satisfies the modified FSF requirement that for all values of `num` (whether >= 0 or < 0), the return value should be equal to `num` itself. This is a minimal modification that makes the code conform to the new specification while maintaining correct syntax.
