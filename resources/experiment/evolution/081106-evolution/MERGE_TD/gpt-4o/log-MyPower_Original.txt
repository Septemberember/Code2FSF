Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MyPower_Original {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
	        res = res * x;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: n == 0
D0: return_value == 1

T1: n > 0
D1: return_value == x ** n

T2: n < 0
D2: return_value == 1

```Modified FSF
T0: (n == 0) || (n < 0)
D0: return_value == 1

T1: n > 0
D1: return_value == x ** n

```

public class MyPower_Modified {
    public static int power(int x, int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            res = res * x;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Combined the conditions for n == 0 and n < 0 into a single condition (n <= 0)
2. Added an early return for the combined condition
3. Kept the original power calculation logic for positive n
4. The modified code still maintains the same behavior but now handles both n == 0 and n < 0 cases uniformly by returning 1

The modified code matches the modified FSF where:
- For n <= 0 (either n == 0 or n < 0), it returns 1
- For n > 0, it returns x raised to the power n (x**n)
