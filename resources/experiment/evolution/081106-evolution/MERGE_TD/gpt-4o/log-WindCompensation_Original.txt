Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class WindCompensation_Original {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 20) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        } else if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = windSpeed - 10;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: windSpeed > 20
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20
D1: compensation == windSpeed - 10

T2: windSpeed <= 10
D2: compensation == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (windSpeed > 20) || (windSpeed > 10 && windSpeed <= 20)
D0: compensation == (windSpeed - 20) * 2

T1: windSpeed <= 10
D1: compensation == 0

```

public class WindCompensation_Modified {
    public static int windCompensation(int windSpeed) {
        int compensation = 0;
        if (windSpeed > 10) {
            compensation = (windSpeed - 20) * 2;
        }
        return compensation;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF combines the first two cases (windSpeed > 20 and 10 < windSpeed ≤ 20) into one condition (windSpeed > 10)
2. In both of these cases, the compensation is now (windSpeed - 20) * 2
3. The else case (windSpeed ≤ 10) remains the same with compensation = 0
4. The code is simplified by removing the nested if-else structure since both conditions now use the same calculation
5. Note that this will give different results than the original for wind speeds between 10 and 20, but matches the modified FSF requirements
