Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GyroHealthCheck_Original {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diffXY = x - y;
        if (diffXY < 0) diffXY = -diffXY;
        int diffYZ = y - z;
        if (diffYZ < 0) diffYZ = -diffYZ;
        int diffXZ = x - z;
        if (diffXZ < 0) diffXZ = -diffXZ;
        int alarm = 0;
        if (diffXY > 10 || diffYZ > 10 || diffXZ > 10) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: (x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10)
D0: alarm == 1

T1: !((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D1: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: (!((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))) || ((x - y > 10 || y - x > 10) || (y - z > 10 || z - y > 10) || (x - z > 10 || z - x > 10))
D0: alarm == 0

```

Based on the modified FSF, we need to modify the code so that it always returns 0 (alarm == 0) regardless of the input conditions. Here's the modified code:

```
public class GyroHealthCheck_Modified {
    public static int gyroHealthCheck(int x, int y, int z) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had two cases:
   - T0: When any difference between values was > 10 → return 1
   - T1: Otherwise → return 0

2. The modified FSF specifies:
   - A single case (T0) that covers all possible inputs
   - The output should always be 0 (D0: alarm == 0)

3. Therefore, we simplified the function to always return 0, as this satisfies the modified FSF requirements.

Note: This modification makes the function trivial as it ignores all input parameters, but it strictly follows the specified modified FSF requirements.
