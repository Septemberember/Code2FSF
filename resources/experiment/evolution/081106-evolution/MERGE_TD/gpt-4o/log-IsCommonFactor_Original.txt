Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class IsCommonFactor_Original {

    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        return a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0
D1: return_value == true

T2: factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0)
D2: return_value == false

```Modified FSF
T0: factor == 0
D0: Exception

T1: (factor != 0 && a % factor == 0 && b % factor == 0) || (factor != 0 && (a % factor != 0 || b % factor != 0))
D1: return_value == true

```

```
public class IsCommonFactor_Modified {
    public static boolean isCommonFactor(int a, int b, int factor) {
        if (factor == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The modified FSF requires that:
   - When factor is 0, throw an exception (same as original)
   - In all other cases (factor != 0), always return true regardless of whether it's actually a common factor or not

2. The original code checked for common factors, but the modified version just needs to return true in all non-zero cases.

3. I kept the exception handling for factor=0 case since it's required by both FSFs.

4. The modified version is much simpler since it doesn't need to do any actual factor checking - it just returns true for all valid inputs (factor != 0).
