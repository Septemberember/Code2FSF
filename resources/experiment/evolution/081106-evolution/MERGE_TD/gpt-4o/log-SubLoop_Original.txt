Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class SubLoop_Original {
    public static int subLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + (-y)

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x - y

T1: (y < 0) || (y == 0)
D1: sum == x + (-y)

```

            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modification combines T1 and T2 from the original FSF into a single case in the modified FSF. The code logic remains the same since the behavior for y < 0 and y == 0 was already the same (adding the absolute value of y to x). The only change needed was to update the documentation/FSF to reflect that these cases are now combined. The actual implementation doesn't need modification as it already correctly handles both cases with the same code path.
