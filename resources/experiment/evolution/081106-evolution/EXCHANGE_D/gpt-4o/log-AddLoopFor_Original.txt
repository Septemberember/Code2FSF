Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoopFor_Original {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = -x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y + x

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y

```Modified FSF
T0: x > 0
D0: sum == y + x

T1: x < 0
D1: sum == y

T2: x == 0
D2: sum == y + x

```

public class AddLoopFor_Modified {
    public static int addLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = y;
        if (x > 0) {
            int n = 0;
            for(n = x; n > 0; ) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else if (x == 0) {
            sum = sum + x;  // This line is redundant but maintains the structure
        }
        // For x < 0, we just keep sum = y (no modification needed)
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. Keeps the original behavior for x > 0 (T0 case)
2. For x < 0 (T1 case), we don't modify sum at all (just return y)
3. For x == 0 (T2 case), we keep the structure but the operation sum = sum + x is effectively a no-op since x is 0
4. The code maintains all the original control flow structure while implementing the new requirements

Note that the else branch for x < 0 is now implicit (we do nothing), which satisfies D1 where sum == y when x < 0.
