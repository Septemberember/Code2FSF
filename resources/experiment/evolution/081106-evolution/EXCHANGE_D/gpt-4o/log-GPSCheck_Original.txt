Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```

The modified FSF is actually identical to the original FSF, so no code changes are needed. The original code already correctly implements the specified behavior. Here's the unchanged code for completeness:

```
public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The code correctly implements all the specified conditions:
1. When both satellites < 4 and signalStrength < 20, alarm = 2 (priority to signal strength)
2. When satellites < 4 but signalStrength is good, alarm = 1
3. When satellites are sufficient but signalStrength < 20, alarm = 2
4. When both conditions are good, alarm = 0

Since the modified FSF matches the original FSF exactly, no modifications to the code are required.
